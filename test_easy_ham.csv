Perhaps the stations cannot publish digital playlists, but you can get
them from www.starcd.com anyway. They use some sort of
listening and recognition technology to identify the music played
on over 1000 US radio stations.

That's very perceptive of you.  Many people are not so willing to
accept their personal reality as skewed by their neuro-physiology.  A
great many popular con games exist by exploiting the perceptions of
these states.

Another oft-exploited neuro-plausibility: The brain is a pretty darn
fine analog associative computer, so it could be the neurochemical
events during the dream have associated themselves with some inner or
external cue to mentally _recreate_ the state-perception like the
predictable tone on striking a bell.

Using -lm 4 is yielding an extra 20% a day, but it gets false positives
where it shouldn't.

Such as an email with a Word doc and the signature below.  After looking at
the Word doc, directions to the sender's cabin, I am convinced it marked the
body, which contains no next except the ""IncrediMail advertisment""
signature, as spam.

So I have to turn off -lm 4.  Razor has been getting other strange emails it
shouldn't with -lm 4 on.

      See the incredimail ad signature I am talking about below:

Date: Not supplied

Feedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. 

*""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. 

Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: 

[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] 

The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. 

In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 

And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. 

I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. 

*""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  

Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. 

*""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: 

- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""


*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.

COMMENTARY

Rebuild at Ground Zero

By LARRY SILVERSTEIN

Earlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the
horrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who
perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers
and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic
amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish
that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,
indeed, for all of us.

But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square
feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers
must be replaced on the site.

About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,
along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.
Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the
economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%
of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms
have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New
York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit
may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.

If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the
vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,
and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers
made a powerful statement to the world that said, ""This is New York, a
symbol of our free economy and of our way of life."" That is why they were
destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and
with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.

In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many
sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on
all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square
feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or
simply never rebuilt.

These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be
recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over
the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the
office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.

Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.
That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy
before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has
remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway
and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements
planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct
""Train-to-the-Plane"" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes
even more the logical locus of office development.

And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task
force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60
million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the
anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only
heightens the need.

As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown
cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that
history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of
office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased
up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the
beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,
at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.

We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site
over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on
line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an
annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'
rate.

Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it
previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an
extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor
will most New Yorkers.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times
that the city ""has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the
future."" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --
and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural
significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what
happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as
residents of the area.

The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.

Mr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm
whose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.

Well, SpamAssassin will just ignore any old X-Spam-whatever headers
it finds, so that cannot be used to get around the filter.

Jeremy Zawodny[1] who works at Yahoo Finance offers an RSS 0.91 feed for every 
stock. It's a beta feature. Here's the feed for Microsoft[2] and one for 
Marimba[3]. Thanks to Jon Udell[4] for the pointer. Nice. Jon also notes that 
Microsoft doesn't show up too strong in the weblog world and describes[5] a 
conversation with John Montgomery about this. What a small world. John and I 
got to know each other when we did the work on SOAP in the late 90s, and weblog 
software is one of the major reasons we were interested in SOAP. So close, but 
so far. But it's never too late!

After a bit of peeking through the exmh tcl and playing with tcl a bit, I got 
the ""catchup unseen messages before cur"" procedure working.  Here's the code 
for everybody and the list archives in case anyone wants it in the future.  
Thanks to John R. LoVerso for putting me on the right track.  

proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    set results {}
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set unseen [Mh_Unseen $exmh(folder)]
    foreach elem $unseen {
         if { $elem < $msg(id) } {
            lappend results $elem
         }
    }
    set pick(ids) $results
    busy PickMarkSeen
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}

If you want to use this, stick it in your .tk/exmh directory, run auto_mkindex 
on it and add the following lines to your .exmh/exmh-defaults:
*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:        ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:         Catch-up all before current
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:         My_Mark2CurSeen

Christ, you sound worse than me.

What I -said- in my post, John, was that instead of having to dole out
stupid refunds, I'd rather they save the costs incurred, knock off one
of those bullshit surcharges that they inevitably charge for promoting
services like these, and move on.  SOmething tells me, it'd balance
out.  Problem is, they're silly, they don't want to do this, and
rather than the legislation coming up with an affective means of
controlling the situation (overcharging) they impose silly
requirements like this.

WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along with
cygwin1.dll.  The .exes are cmdline programs.  One is a POP3 proxy.  If I
currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name
timmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, and
that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy.  In that way the
proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader
tells it the user name is.

This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and ""all it does"" is
insert a

    X-Text-Classification:  one_of_the_class_names_you_picked

header into your email before passing it on to your mail reader.  The user
then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and ""do
something about it"" (and even Outlook can handle *that* much <wink>).

The user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examples
of each class of message, and for running the cmdline tools to train the
classifier.

You're a bit too vague on your ""[rpm package]"" here...
Maybe this will help you :

You can just put the name, of the name and version, and even the release,
but the entire filename will not work!

I'm not familiar with Dell Dimension XPS, and, to be honest, not familiar
with any brand-name computers. Most of my experience is China
motherboards, but I've seen same behavior once. Changing the battery helps
that time. It was big round battery with 'Panasonic' on it.
Computer starts beeping then we removed battery from MB. It even booted up
(well, loosing time and some other things).

Just my 2 cents.

See your /etc/sendmail.cf file, there are a number of methods for limiting
the number of concurrent sendmail processes, either by load average (I'm
sure), or concurrency (I think)... I use sendmail anymore (I use qmail) but
I'm sure that if you look in the config file, you will see what you need...

I found a nice little Perl script for this purpose called rotate, which 
makes the process of rotating log files very simple.  If there's an 
official source for this script, I couldn't find it.  (My hosting 
provider, pair.com, has it installed, and that's where I found it.) 
 However, redistribution appears to be allowed, so I've attached it.

Good luck...

1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
   folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
   hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
   characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the 
article I was commenting on... Rohit]

In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The 
Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most 
subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which 
merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By 
maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, 
if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.

The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce 
these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from 
Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all 
Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to 
SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; 
censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in 
China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of 
IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in 
the article.

Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic 
costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free 
flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors 
sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest 
of the Web?

To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector 
programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just 
imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure 
access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom 
of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most 
of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.

On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* 
the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...

Best,
   Rohit Khare

===========================================================

The search goes on
China backtracks on banning Google—up to a point

Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
 From The Economist print edition

IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, 
is gougou, meaning “doggy”. For the country's fast-growing population of 
Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving 
an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked 
access to Google from Internet service providers in China—apparently 
because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to 
forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been 
restored.

An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More 
sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to 
use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. 
Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by 
Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for 
Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.

After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users 
posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. 
Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet 
providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site 
to far less powerful search engines in China.

Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, 
BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to 
censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking 
individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be 
filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key 
words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this 
week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on 
Google for Falun Gong—a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China—
usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search 
also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.

(Via Robot Wisdom)   Maybe you UC folk know these people?

http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-08/lcc-sph082202.php

Working at Lewis & Clark College, the University of California at Berkeley, 
the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Stanford University, 
the interdisciplinary team:

    * confirmed speculation that the gecko's amazing climbing ability 
depends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der Waals forces,

    * rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water 
molecules, and

* discovered that the gecko's adhesive depends on geometry, not surface 
chemistry. In other words, the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot 
hairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko's stickiness.

To verify its experimental and theoretical results, the gecko group then 
used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips from two 
different materials.

""Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted,"" notes Autumn, assistant 
professor of biology at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. ""Our 
initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically 
inspired dry, adhesive microstructures, which can have widespread 
applications.""

what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places 
where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to 
allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my 
knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how 
worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot 
long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
or less?

This step is unneccesary -- unless you've changed the scripts 
much, any test in the logs which aren't in the rules files will 
just be ignored I think.  You do seem to have changed the 
logs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify 
immutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the 
code and couldn't fully make out how it had changed.  I think we 
want to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there 
somewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff?  For 
the last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently 
(by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have 
immutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.

I'll agree that webforms are a pain in the ass, however it would seem to 
me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the 
autoform function, providing more info than you want to.  That and some 
entity would be holding the passport info, thus have all that data in the 
first place.
Personally i'd never trust them not to at least use it internally to 
market to me, if not sell/rent out.  Just think of the ability 
they'd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was 
tracked to you.  And thats just the marketing side of it.

Hello,

I'm new to the list.
I wanted to find out who tried recompiling a working apt rpm for (null) or 
psyche.  I would like to get good GStreamer packages done by monday when 
it's released.

BTW, in the archive I saw some posts regarding the GStreamer repository.  
I'm not sure why they were posted on this list ;) In any case, I'm the rpm 
maintainer, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I was trying to get an updated apt rpm from http://dave.cridland.net/, but 
the http port is closed.  Dave, if you're reading this, please let me know 
where I can get the updated rpm.

Thanks,
Thomas

Subject: [zzzzteana] Betamax finally laid to rest
Reply-To: zzzzteana@yahoogroups.com

Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm


Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. 

They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. 

 
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. 

Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. 

Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 

""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. 

Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. 

The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. 

But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. 

In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 

Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 

The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 

A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 

Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

It seems like ATTWS will offer a service that'll tell you where your friends 
(or children or spouse or whatever) are ... I haven't seen it announced, but 
from their ""Explanation of Rates and Charges. ""Find Friends service will only 
locate a compatible mobile device with mMode service that (1) has granted you

OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)

When the political canvassers come to my door during the campaigns,
I always wonder why cigarette packages are labelled with warnings
whereas political brochures are not; the statistics clearly show
which is the greater, more senseless, and more preventable killer.

Isn't it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon (or pancetta, 
really)? You mix in the raw egg to the cooked pasta and the heat of the pasta 
cooks the egg. That's my understanding.

This is a standard trap for people building things from source. It's
generally wise to have a special ""build"" environment to avoid these
hassles. Most likely you have some library loading path in your env. An
strace of the app will show it:

	the-app 2>&1 | grep dude

Personally, I have a script called logbuild whose entire purpose is to
start a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The
prevents this kind of error. Since configure yanks all sorts of ill
documented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,
various LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.

Often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile
for building stuff.

Cheers,

Right you are.  The SRPM includes a patch to enable it, but then the
specfile defaults to not applying that patch.  I saw the former but
missed the later.  Egad, what a convoluted maze.

Sorry for the misinformation!

_Jeffrey Zeldman_: OS X Blues update[1]. 

    A couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity 
    of OS X, which derives its power from Unix and XML, and the rules of 
    standards-based web development, which also compels you to do things the 
    right way instead of using five different non-standard hacks. The parallel 
    is not without merit. Building web pages the right way is hard at first, 
    but once you get it, you never want to go back. Regardless, we miss OS 9's 
    flexibility and ease of use, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that 
    feeling of loss.

Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is
sexually active or not?

1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman
   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes
   hair shiny and skin smooth.

2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering
   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses
   the pores and makes your skin glow.

3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that
   romantic dinner.

4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches
   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable
   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!

5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body
   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and
   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.

6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually
   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called
   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!

7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE
   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.

8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages
   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid
   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.

9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release
   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.

10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national
    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.

ENJOY SEX!

These are some good comments and I'd like to share an opinion here.  (Is that permitted? :)

I started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$.  I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.

What I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.

I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.  Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.

I don't know if there's a sendmail-ish way (it's not in the -d0.1 output),
but this should work:

$ strings `which sendmail` | grep -i milter

If you get a long list of function/message looking phrases, milter
is built-in.  If you get something like:

Warning: Filter usage ('X') requires Milter support (-DMILTER)
Milter Warning: Option: %s requires Milter support (-DMILTER)
@(#)$Id: milter.c,v 1.1.1.2 2002/03/12 18:00:36 zarzycki Exp $

then it's not built-in. :)

This is the headline of the month, possibly the year: ""Doctors Grow Pig Teeth 
in Rat Intestines."" Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's 
like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment! 

    U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in 
    rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental 
    revolution. 

    Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment 
    suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a 
    person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her 
    own cells. 

    ""The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in 
    biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize 
    dentistry,"" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that 
    focuses on oral and facial science.

Ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the
Ten Commandments.  It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit,
too.

In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was
actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into
slavery.  Certainly the US southerners were particularly sensitive to
the term 'man stealer' in a way I didn't understand.

Yep, I know he said all holy books.  No, I don't know if this site was
blowing hot air.  It just read like someone had done their homework.

This is not a correct assessment.  The American public couldn't care
less.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a
threat, and it isn't the third-world.  Many European and other developed
nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American
interests.  Its been going on for years and isn't even news.  Things
have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased.  For
better or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too.  As with
most backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big
players.

Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US.  You'll
find that half the countries on that list are European.  Most people are
unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years.

Bullshit.  The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,
obviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do
dirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with
government ""advisors"" along for the mission).  I've always wondered what
the deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that
we've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders
against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and
in recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the
military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these
missions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was
never assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of
covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.

Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created
meaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion
under any other guise.

Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems
the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill
faster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the
European way of doing things is beyond me.

The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack
for medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral""
anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?
I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see
coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. 

For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,
but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.

I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast
majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the
country at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled
anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. 
Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of
the universe.  I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider
Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But
from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this
way?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the
years.

I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.

First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and
culturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout
North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and
very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the
hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly
foreign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with
having the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally
identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A
Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with
your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same
language and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a
wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New
Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live
than some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places are
farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.

Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a
neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? 
In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your
German construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,
only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous
superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?

In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the
US.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with
relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very
similar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have
dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an
advantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't
understand a word they are saying either.

I am trying to rebuild the recently posted ALSA driver package for my 
kernel.  Although I run Red Hat 7.3, I am not using a Red Hat kernel 
package: my kernel is lovingly downloaded, configured, and built by 
hand.  Call me old fashioned.

Sadly, the RPM rebuild fails part way through:

     % rpm --rebuild alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-fr6.src.rpm

     gcc -DALSA_BUILD -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE=1 \

     sound.c:41: (near initialization for \
     __ksymtab_snd_hack_usb_set_interface.value')

     make[1]: *** [sound.o] Error 1

The line in question looks like this:

	/* USB workaround */
	#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2, 5, 24)
	#if defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO) || \
	defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO_MODULE) || \

Any suggestions?

SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec 
dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used 
for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.

That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 
question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 
question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
$1-20 range (depending on the application).

As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves 
around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.

I've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums
for several years.  I've always found archaeology interesting for no
particular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I
actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.

Defrosting the past

Ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty
of a warming world

BY ALEX MARKELS

As he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed
Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000
feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and
amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't
live this high up.' ""

Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,
where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a
bison–one that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary
discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it
could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's
probably a lot more like it yet to be found.""

And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and
snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru
to Alaska–a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and
industry–have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As
the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is
emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep
freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky
fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our
predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.

""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through
studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude
archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic
Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered
in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice
Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have
offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as
the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional
treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.

Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother
Nature–and looters–take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can
deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're
often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them
don't even realize they're ancient.

That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in
British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a
dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,""
recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked
closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""

Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur
trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc
bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed
the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what
seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter
lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago
Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who
may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human
from the period ever found in North America.

Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could
explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the
first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people
living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we
see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""

Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek
caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,
Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south
Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in
caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been
caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a
wildlife biologist with the Yukon government.

Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a
pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a
4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the
ice patch–and scores of others around the region–revealed icy layer
cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800
years of changing hunting practices.

Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the
ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.
Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded
some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts
up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research
project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about
1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing
darts.""

Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They
are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where
glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to
have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell
and St. Elias mountain ranges–the United States' most glaciated
terrain–and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing
European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as
the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude
archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're
probably about the only ones happy about it.""

""rssflowersalignright""A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the 
negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  

I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  

At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did 
it, you can too.

There were four buddies golfing and the first guy said, ""I had to
promise my wife that I would paint the whole outside of the house
just to go golfing.""

The second guy said, ""I promised my wife that I would remodel the
kitchen for her.""

The third guy said, ""You guys have it easy! I promised my wife that
I would build her a new deck."" They continued to play the hole.
Then the first guy said to the fourth guy, ""What did you have to
promise your wife?""

The fourth guy replied, ""I didn't promise anything."" All the guys
were shocked, ""How did you do it?!"" He replied, ""It's simple. I
set the alarm clock for 5:30. Then I poked my wife and asked, 'Golf
course or intercourse?' And she said, 'Wear your sweater.'""

 Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties
 By Roger Boyes
 
 
 
 MANAGERS of Germanys political parties are having difficulty explaining their
 enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed
 largely from Mein Kampf, Hitlers personal manifesto. The incident illustrates
 how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an
 election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to
 those of the Führer. 
 
 Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the
 present Chancellor, said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union
 headquarters in Ingolstadt. Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the
 flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland, said the letter,
 signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. 
 
 The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Many thanks for your nice
 thoughts, replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for
 membership. 
 
 The letter used chunks of Hitlers book, which is still banned in Germany.
 History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.
 
 
 The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of
 existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,
 the letter-writer said. So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March
 sun. Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler
 was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. 
 
 Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaders words, were sent to the other
 political parties and drew sympathetic responses. I read your letter with
 great interest and pleasure, the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in
 Cologne, said. 
 
 Great that you want to join us! enthused the Green Party headquarters. The
 Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball
 at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the
 star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by
 Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor. 
 
 I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing
 extremism, said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist
 Rainer Popp. I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. 
 
 For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special
 Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called  with packets of
 election material from zealous political headquarters, Herr Popp said. 
 
 I was stunned that political parties could react in this way  I reckon I
 would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Adolf Hitler.

http://www.snopes.com/quotes/bush.htm

Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, ""The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""

Status:   False.

Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""

The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""

This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.

Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

How do you feed procmail? Not with a .forward, I'd guess.

How does mail enter your system anyway? Per fetchmail maybe? Or direct 
 SMTP-delivery? Or does it just magically hit your spool?

Lotsa questions...

Which was my point. Gurls don't do hyperpromiscuity as a life style. It's
interesting that you're launching into a diatribe, and threaten using
instant argument (just add hominem) instead of assuming I might be not
just pulling this whole thing out my nether orifice.

Yeah, I think it could be also difficult finding a gay bathhouse in Thule,

This doesn't happen because it couldn't happen. No one would want to. 
Because you feel that way. Correct?

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code

John Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
[1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
gold rush. 

Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. 

There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. 
And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead 
of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

I may have a different version of ""sh"" than you do; the double quotes
around the backticks work for my ""sh"".

(In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you're probably
safe without the double quotes.  The only reason I put them in is that
I have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose
names contain spaces.  If all your folders have safe names, you don't
need special quoting.)

Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).

However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.

I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.

Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.

I hope this helps some.

I haven't seen any official data on the web (the high-ranking hits are 
overrun by religious bigots), but there's some anecdotal evidence to be 
found in

	http://sunsite.berkeley.edu:2020/dynaweb/teiproj/oh/science/aidsnur2/@Generic__BookTextView/5406

(search for promiscuity). They mention 300 to 500 partners a year. 
(Anecdotally. This is not a statistic). They also mention that this was 
specific to gay males. Lesbians don't dig promiscuity in that degree.

Actually, you use both.

No, even best supercapacitors are a long way to go from reasonably good 
electrochemical energy sources. But you can recharge and discharge them 
very quickly, and they take lots more of cycles than the best battery. 
Ideal for absorbing the braking energy and turn them into smoking tires 
few moments or minutes afterwards.

I don't see any reason why EVs shouldn't dominate dragster runs. The
traction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put
the motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice
into them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty
of time to smoke anything.

Of course, it doesn't roar, and spew smokage, so it won't happen.

People just can't stop thinking <wink>.  The classifier should work best
when trained on a wholly random spattering of real life.  If real life
contains duplicates, then that's what the classifier should see.

Sure!  I think it's relevant, but maybe for another purpose.  Paul Svensson
is thinking harder about real people <wink> than the rest of us, and he may
be able to get use out of approaches that identify closely related spam.
For example, some amount of spam is going to end up in the ham training data
in real life use, and any sort of similarity score to a piece of known spam
may be an aid in finding and purging it.

A new KPMG study concludes that the RIAA and its member companies are hurting 
themselves by focusing on cracking down on P2P sharing instead of figuring out 
ways to earn a living with it. 

    Media companies must put less emphasis on protecting digital content and 
    instead find ways to make money from digital music and movies if they hope 
    to beat back copyright pirates who threaten their businesses, according to 
    a study released on Wednesday from KPMG... 

    ""They complain about the Napsters,"" she said, referring to the bankrupt 
    music swap site that was found to violate U.S. copyright laws. ""But why do 
    the Napsters exist, because the marketplace wants them."" 

    Steel said that if the issue ""is not on boardroom table ... then that 
    boardroom has problems.""

It's all here in these 10 lines, otherwise known as the
""I'll try my damnest to paste something"" procedure:

# Return the current selection (from any window) or cut buffer 0.
proc Text_Selection {} {
    if [catch {selection get} sel] {
        if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {
            if [catch {cutbuffer get 0} sel] {
                return """"
            }
        }
    }
    return $sel
}

This is in textSelection.tcl, and is what exmh uses to find text to paste.
It is that last ""cutbuffer get"" that is wacky, because exmh sticks its
own deletions into that little know stash, and is probably the only
application on the planet that still looks there.  We should probably
just disable that - try this variant:

proc Text_Selection {} {
    if [catch {selection get} sel] {
        if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {
            return """"
        }
    }
    return $sel
}

Everything funnels through here, so you just need to hack this one spot.

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments -

images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt

Ananova:

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.



Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers"".



Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.

In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.

But no-one reported anything to the police.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen ""a red blob"" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.

In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.

Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

Politicians worldwide are discovering the internet - what a great tool 
for fascism, once you got the laws in place to solve that whole 
'anonymity' thing. Also I notice this story shows the truth - the 
Canadian government is really located in Washington, DC, Ottawa is just

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*

*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*

A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> 
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.

The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
<http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada 
<http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.

Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the 
process of considering.

If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.

Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, 
or ratified, the treaty.

Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.

""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case.""

Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems.""

Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.

""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.

Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.

Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
the draft says.

Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""

""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously,"" Hosein said.

A representative for George Radwanski 
<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
the paper as it stands.""

Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca

Chemistry types have a method for
dealing with this question without
dragging in the calculus:

Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly
affected by gravity, resulting in
the potential energy for a mass M
to be linear in height h: Mgh.

What relative concentrations will
we have when two different packets
of air are in equilibrium?

If they are at the same height, we
will have half the mass in one, and
half the mass in the other, and the
amount flowing from one to the other
balances the amount flowing in the
opposite direction.[0]

If they are at differing heights,
then a greater percentage of the
higher air tends to descend than
that percentage of the lower air
which ascends.  In order for the
two flows to balance, the higher
packet must contain less air than
the lower, and the mass balance
of the flows corresponds thusly:

    high percentage of thin air
    ---------------------------
    low percentage of dense air

Now, rates are exponential in
energy differences[1], so that
theoretically we should expect
an exponential decay in height,
to compensate.  How does it go
in practice?

-Dave

[0] How well does it balance?
    Chemical equilibria seem 
    stable, as they deal with
    very large numbers over a
    very long time.  Economic
    equilibria are viewed from
    the mayfly standpoint of
    individual people, and so,
    at best, the shot noise is
    very visible.

[1] That is to say, rates will
    be exponential in the free
    energy differences between
    endpoints and a transition
    state.  We can ignore that
    complication in this model.

We all learned that sooner or later, right? When I got down to that myself

Strange.
Anyway, although I'd easily recommend upgrading 7.x to 7.3 using apt, I
wouldn't for 7.x to 8.0 as they are C++ binary incompatible... and apt is
entirely written in C++ and dynamically linked :-/

Still, that doesn't explain a core dump :-(

Why ""search""? There's more than enough to choose from here :

Doesn't seem *likely*, as it appeared in about 900 of about 14,000 spams.
It could be specific to one of his bait addresses, though -- don't know.  A
nice thing about a statistical inferencer is that you really don't have to

I'm going to blow it off -- it's just another instance of being pointlessly

Both are reliable.  ""Reliability"" is more a function of the software
engineer.  I've written complicated mission-critical server software in
Java that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is
sitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are running
months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing
lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure
every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers
to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a
design/programming issue.

That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then
re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a
language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 
The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly
detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around
bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give
you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of
a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune
(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 
Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you
could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by
raw performance scalability.

That was my thinking.  My recollection about the first message being valid
is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting,
for example, or you are selecting a message to display.

glob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder *
will return an unsorted list of the directory's contents.
But the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.
Exmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is
already pretty tricky

In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,
but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to
check their date stamp, you could just read them again.  Also, now that
we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change
every time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about
the folder.

Ananova:  
Dracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest

A controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be
switched away from Transylvania.
Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in
Bucharest instead.
It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the
original proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.
PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider
in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the
project.
But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the
inspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost
the local economy.
Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with
the Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.
Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: ""The pre-feasibility report from
PWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in
Bucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it.""
The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost
train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a
reconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake.
The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation
Unesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on
October 15.

There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5"" drive with a
laptop directly. However, you can get an external firewire or USB
cradle and attach it to the laptop like that, and any 3.5"" drive
will work in that case.

Example :

No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:

	# mount -o remount,rw /usr

This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
users anyway.

Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
apologies.)

IMO spamtrap data that's well-cleaned and monitored is fine.

To my mind there's 3 types of spamtraps:

  1. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps when the user closes
    the account

  2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the
    user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed
    from them etc.

  3. real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers.

The latter 2 are the most effective, but #1 is a real PITA; it takes lots
of maintainance to avoid ham getting in there.  Some of my spamtrap data
had a few 1's contributed by ISPs, and I hadn't spent enough time sifting
for legit mail that was slipping through.  So I felt better leaving
them out for this run, apart from what I'd hand-cleaned.

Better late than never -- I received a grant from Project Athena, MIT's original courseware effort, and found at the end that they hadn't thought much about distribution of the courseware.  Instead, they had gotten wrapped up with X and various Unix tools, and other useful, but not strictly educational efforts.

LOL!  They're not doomed at all.  Thousands of men wear cb2000s to work 
every day (along with other chastity devices).    They are not just 
decorations.  You will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your 
keyholder allows you to.  Anyhow, I know better than to have this 
type of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and 
consensually.  (:  There is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the 
people who use these.  There is power exchange instead.  Lots of 
variations on the definition, but this one's from Gloria Brame's site:

Power exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the 
dominant. The exchange takes place when the returned energy from the 
dominant empowers the submissive. 

Anyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares 
to read them, but I assure you, the chastity device business is doing very 
well, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one.  It's not coercion, 
it is creative sensuality.  (:

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.

'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

The point could also be to hassle the sunbather for reasons not given in
the story.  The sunbather has probably pissed off the complainers in other
ways, too.

Law and society are wholeheartedly trivial.  Big fuzzy concepts like
""sluts vs. moms"" are convenient vehicles for petty disputes as often as
not.

The associated links cover that: The surface temperature in spots
frequented by people is warmer (hence all our groundbased sensors
reporting global warming) although the overall environmental
temperature is decreasing.

Apparently, the real news is not that there is no global warming, but
that our models of the warming were seriously flawed by naive
convection models.  This too was not news to the theoreticians: All
that has happened is that NASA has confirmed the naiive convection
concerns.

Why wait until you're dead? I'm sure there's enough carbon in
the fat from your typical liposuction job to make a decent diamond.

While that's not a lot of training data, I picked random subsets of my
corpora and got much better behavior (this is rates.py output; f-p rate per
run in left column, f-n rate in right):

Another full run with another randomly chosen (but disjoint) 220 of each in
each set was much the same.  The score distribution is also quite sharp:

It's hard to say whether you need better ham or better spam, but I suspect
better spam <wink>.  18 of the 30 most powerful discriminators here were
HTML-related spam indicators; the top 10 overall were:

        '<font' 266 0.99
        'content-type:text/plain' 275 0.172932
        '</body>' 312 0.99
        '</html>' 329 0.99

        'python' 428 0.01
        'content-type:text/html' 454 0.99

The HTML tags come from non-multipart/alternative HTML messages, from which
HTML tags aren't stripped, and there are lots of these in my spam sets.

That doesn't account for it, though.  If I strip HTML tags out of those too,
the rates are only a little worse:

The 4th-strongest discriminator *still* finds another HTML clue, though!

        'subject:Python' 164 0.01
        'money' 169 0.99
        'content-type:text/plain' 185 0.2

        'click' 519 0.99

Heh.  I forgot all about &nbsp;.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]


The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.


The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]



BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...


In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

Cheers,
RAH

Classic X copy-and-paste behavior is that you can only paste what is
currently highlighted.  In fact, it is the act of highlighting a
selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer.  X has
no ""copy"" command -- if you highlighted it, you just copied it.

If ab application has a ""copy"" command that you can choose to use
separately from the process of highlighting something, that command
is something the application authors wrote on their own.  (And it it
likely that an application that wrote an internal ""copy"" command would
also have their own customized ""paste"" command, to make sure the two
work together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste
functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste
functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you
are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.

Lovely quote from the Forbes 400 list:
""and not a single Astor, Vanderbilt or Morgan rates a mention on the
current Forbes Four Hundred. ""

But you have to studiously ignore the 4 Rockefellers, 3 Gettys, 3
Hearsts,  Fords, Kelloggs, Wrigleys,
and so on.

There are more self-made people on the list than I previously alluded to
- I made a mistake. Most
of them seem to have Ivy League educations, or are Ivy League dropouts,
suggesting to me that they weren't
exactly poor to start with. Some of them have lovely self-made stories
like:

Thanks Tom and Jacob. The above works, but without the double quotes: i.e. 

sh -c 'for f in `folders -recurse -fast` ; do sortm +""$f"" ; done'

I'd attach this command to the sorting menu if I knew any tcl...

OTOH, look into DCC (Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse,
http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/), which uses fuzzy checksums.
It's quite likely that DCC's checksumming scheme is better than
something any of us would throw together for personal use (no offense,
Skip!).  But I have no personal experience of it.

You could read about regular expressions.
^kernel$ matches ""kernel"" and nothimg more.
Kerne, kernel-smp and kernel-enterprise are the kernel packages you
might be running in a RH system. Packages like kernel-headers,
kernel-BOOT and kernel-doc aren't matched. If it just said ""kernel"", it
would match *all* those packages.

That shouldn't have been able to happen, but I've just made the code slightly

Trying to shoutdown a speaker or being loud and rowdy while someone else is
trying to speak (in the vernacular, 'getting in their face') is rude and
disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a
criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it
with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on...
these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what
Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being
rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence
people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of
human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their
message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of
how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil
at worst.

Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has 
been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to 
sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a 
one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages 
removed.  (I think.)

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and 
Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it 
only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the 
""Exmh_Debug Reading $filename"" output in the debug log to see when sequences 
are actually reread from disk.


My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to 
investigate that.

It seems to only support PPPoA and not PPPoE. You need one that supports
PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a
bridge, it'll probably work, but you'd be left leaving the computer on,
which would defeat the purpose of getting a router.

The best router I've come accross is the Zyxel 643. Eircom supply this,
but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
online from America or the UK.

Hope this is useful,
Joe

_Sam Ruby_: Stark raving mad[1]. 

    This post was entered in Radio, extracted using a batch file via some 
    UserTalk, parsed using Perl, cleaned up by tidy and a C program of my own 
    design, transferred to intertwingly using scp, and then ssh triggers 
    unpacking on the destination site, where a shell script takes over: invokes 
    indexing using Jakarta's Lucene, and then a python script pings weblogs.com 
    and blo.gs. 

Tom Stoppard (_Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead_): 

    Guildenstern: &#8220;A man talking sense to himself is no madder than a man 
    talking nonsense not to himself.&#8221;
    Rosencrantz: &#8220;Or just as mad.&#8221;

In 1986, we in the U.S. were playing the Nintendo Entertainment System (known 
as the Famicom in Japan), and roughly a third of the music for its first set of 
games was written by Hirokazu ""Hip"" Tanaka, then with Nintendo Co. Ltd.He has 
written music for countless other games as well as designing the Game Boy 
Camera and Printer, and also scored the soundtrack to the Pokemon TV series. 
Alexander Brandon catches up with the legendary composer.

Cool, one less package to maintain :)

One interesting thing about alsaplayer is that RedHat's XMMS package in RH8 will
probably not play mp3 files. But alsaplayer does play mp3s ""out of the box"".

Also, they are developing rapidly in their CVS and looks like their next version
of alsaplaer will be pretty cool, but I have no idea when it will be ready.

I am wondering whether there's a way that I can use sitescooper and/or plucker
or some other free utility to convert word documents into something a bit
more palmos friendly?

I don't have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;
I know that if this were not the case, in Word I could save them as some
other more friendly format.

Pitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind Dates
Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ET

BERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they
are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the
bar is pitch black.

The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on
senses other than sight.

Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland
Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been
blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery
and drinks.

""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't
find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish
is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said.

In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose
complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like
a fish, meat or vegetarian option.

""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and
smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and
sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.

""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over
and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he
added.

Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.

An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to
help, Scharnbach said.

And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have
actually been eating.

Yesterday Viridiana came to my place and dragged me out to look at the sky. It 
was beautiful. Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today 
Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). 
Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much 
street light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from 
NASA...

I think I'm going to become one of _those_ people. You know, one of those 
people who has a &#8220;Semantic Web&#8221; category on their weblog. This will 
be a Geek Purity Test question someday. Onward: 

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Fun with RDF[1]. &#8220;RDF can actually be fun, as long as 
you don't foolishly invest too much ego in trying to store RSS 1.0, or wander 
off into flame wars.&#8221; From which we find: 
- _Shelley Powers_: The RDF Query-O-Matic[2], and The RDF Query-O-Matic 
explained[3]. &#8220;The Query-o-Matic accepts the name of an RDF file (any 
valid RDF file), and an RDFQL (RDF Query Language) query, and will print out a 
test value found as a result of that query.&#8221; 
- _Marcus Campbell_: &#8220;My FOAF autocreation script is moving along nicely
[4]. It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of 
bites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements 
from these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF 
file for me.&#8221; 
- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. &#8220;After spending some time 
badgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and 
not getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay 
again. I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. 
The magic was gone.&#8221;

[can't think of how I'd be running
afoul of the spam filters with this
post, so here's the second try...]

Kissinger's book _Does America Need
a Foreign Policy?_ provides a few
handy abstractions:

> The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between
> values [""idealism""] and interests [""realism""] and, occasionally,
> between peace and justice.

Also, he views historical American
approaches to foreign policy as a
bundle of three fibers:

Hamiltonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to preserve balances of power.

Wilsonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to further democracy, etc.

Jacksonian - We should never get
  involved in foreign adventures.
  Unless we're attacked.  Then we
  go Rambo.

He has tactfully left out the hard
realists*; as for the rest I gather
wilsonians play the idealists, and
hamiltonians act where values and
interests intersect, and jacksonians 
act only when values and interests
overlap.

Kissinger himself seems to be a
Hamiltonian; much of the book is
about how he thinks we ought to
be shaping the balance of power
in various foreign regions.

Maybe I've been too affected by
Kant, but I can't see that such
a strategy works unless one can
count on a Bismarck runnning it:
how lopsided does the US look if
everyone tries to run a balance
of power politics?

Kings and tyrants generically have
followed the same power politics:
garner popular support by keeping
potential oligarchs down.  In other
traditions, a king is a legitimate
tyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate
king.  In the US, I'd hope that we,
like Samuel, wouldn't naturally make
such fine distinctions.

Sure, but at the moment I have to stop reading email for a few hours and do

I think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct
spelling is important.  Would be interesting to see if this same effect is
applicable to written forms of other languages, maybe even Japanese romongi.

Using Razor2 via SpamAssasin.

System is Solaris 2.7, with qmail. Spamassassin run via user's procmail.
All users who use SA have run razor-register.

Razor2 is failing, and I can't find anything in the limited docs or on 
google on it,
and I'm hoping someone can help.

The error (which doesn't prevent SA from working) is:

Oct  2 06:38:22 sancho2 qmail: 1033565902.186041 delivery 4588: success:

erl/5.6.1/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm_line_374./did_0+0+1/

Looking at Dns.pm doesn't really help me, and Razor2::Client::Agent appears 
to be in the right place,
in /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Razor2/Client.

Ideas?

...Chris

Well Beberg, unless you're really into Anime and actually hold true
that dead people can send email, I think Geege's subject is just dandy.
Especially since she removed herself from the hive that is aol (and
placed herself unto another, but hey :-))

Geege:  I think its cute when he worries like that, don't you?

A lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the 
responses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something 
here: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not 
the target audience for Phoenix.

Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.


- The link toolbar is: 


- critical to my day-to-day use 
- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?
-  link what?



- The sidebar is 


- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution 
- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have 
splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML 
panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... 
- a waste of real estate



- Form auto-fill 


- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information 
first 
- should just happen automatically



- Downloads 


- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! 
- should be clearly visible and understandable.



- Toolbars should 


- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the 
window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be 
able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be 
able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and 
context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file 
system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and 
mow my lawn and... 
- be customizable within reason



- Composer should 


- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. 
Everywhere! 
- not be part of a Web browser.



- Mail should 


- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a 
difference? 
- be a separate application.




Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, 
you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to 
the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or 
mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them 
yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will 
facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an 
alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should 
automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. 

Why? 

A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become 
as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The 
geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.

Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an 
opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the 
browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the 
user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions 
within Netscape.

Heheheh... So becomming a university professor was your second career 
choice?  ;-)

Seriously though (or not, as the case may be), The Amazing Spiderman had 
many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 
'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a 
spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city 
blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.

As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not 
really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, 
ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There 
have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the 
biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey 
sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the 
presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they 
were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result 
of some sort of quantum entanglement?

I spun another AlsaPlayer build, this time on my (null) box. I do not know what this
means but the Curl stuff compiled in this time.

It's sounding damn cool with the new alsa drivers. Thanks to Matthias for the Alsa
RPMS. Great job bring sound to the masses.

Yeesh.  Sounds like what you need is something to kick up once and score
an entire mailbox.

Wait a second...  So *that's* why you wanted -u.

If you can spare the memory, you might get better performance in this
case using the pickle store, since it only has to go to disk once (but
boy, does it ever go to disk!)  I can't think of anything obvious to
speed things up once it's all loaded into memory, though.  That's
profiler territory, and profiling is exactly the kind of optimization
I just said I wasn't going to do :)

I guess I don't get any points, do I? No, didn't think so.

	You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to
postscript and png.  You could also try openoffice and/or abiword if you
have x installed.

	Great! ;)

I'm reading this now as that you trained on about 220 spam and about 220
ham.  That's less than 10% of the sizes of the training sets I've been
using.  Please try an experiment:  train on 550 of each, and test once
against the other 550 of each.  Do that a few times making a random split
each time (it won't be long until you discover why directories of individual
files are a lot easier to work -- e.g., random.shuffle() makes this kind of
thing trivial for me).

I did so.  Alas, stripping HTML tags from all text still hurts the f-n rate

Last time I tried this (see tokenizer.py comments), the f-n rate after
stripping tags ranged from 0.982% to 1.781%, with a median of about 1.34%,
so we've made tons of progress on the f-n rate since then.  But the mere
presence of HTML tags still remains a significant clue for c.l.py traffic,
so I'm left with the same comment:

> # XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
> # XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.

If we want to take the focus of this away from c.l.py traffic, I can't say
what effect HTML stripping would have (I don't have suitable test data to
measure that on).

After the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science 
fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable 
science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of 
science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding 
what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction: 

    Squid on the Mantelpiece 

    Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the 
    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot 
    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic 
    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming 
    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to 
    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when 
    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the 
    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary 
    thematics is known as the ""squid on the mantelpiece."" 

    Card Tricks in the Dark 

    Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private 
    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia 
    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and 
    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose. 
    (Attr. Tim Powers) 

I had the cold from hell all weekend and I'm jetlagged, but I wanted to get 
some links up before I hit the sack. Until tomorrow! Link[1] Discuss[2]

I'd suggest using Precedence: junk. Albeit it's no standard header does most 
Software already recognize it. Courier eg. doesn't send auto-replies to 
mails with the Precedence bulk or junk. I think Outlook does handle these 
special, too. [1] says:
| Autoresponses should always contain the header
|          Precedence: junk
| Notice the spelling of ""prec-e-dence"". In particular, count the number of
| n:s (and a:s and s:es, if you're totally agraphic and/or from the United
| States). This will prevent well-tempered mail programs from generating
| bounce messages for these. If the recipient can't be reached, the
| autoresponder message is simply discarded.

I posted about this last week, and I'm still stumped.  apt-get is just
not working for me, and I can't figure out what the problem is.

I've tried removing the apt rpms, making sure to remove any traces left
behind (/etc/apt /var/state/apt /var/cache/apt), and still, I get
""couldn't find package xmms-mp3"" when running ""apt-get install xmms-mp3"".

Any clues?  Here's a log of a fresh try:

That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what
you sent doesn't support packages named ""kernel-smp""). I'd also prefer a
cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...
probably ""--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp"". Sound good enough?
The BuildRequires on ""kernel-source"" will also need to be removed because
it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/

More ideas are welcome.

Excellent evidence of the herd. Just imagine if the anonymous noise injected into our world newsphere (noosphere?) was, say, a fraudulent story that a stock accounting scandal had been accused and the evildoers were shorting. 

Oh, wait, that happened. An unemployed Orange County student took down Emulex...

Enjoy!

Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All

October 2, 2002
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 




 

Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""


Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the
World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds
would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness
was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The
reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News
program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. 

There was only one problem, the health organization said in
a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds
would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the
subject. 

""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports
originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United
Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we
have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" 

All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,
cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a
blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.
But none reported any scientific details from the study or
the names of the scientists who conducted it. 

On ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a
conversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:
""There's a study from the World Health Organization, this
is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women
and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural
blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth
within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as
brunets."" 

Ms. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""


Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the
anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London
who said he had read it in a British newspaper. 

In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that
unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in
Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected
the last true blond to hail from Finland. 

The British accounts were replete with the views of
bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow
blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare
genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an
endangered species. 

Journalists in London said last night that the source of
the reports was probably one of several European news
agencies that are used by the British press, but it
remained unclear which one. 

Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the
report was probably distributed by The Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it
up,"" he said. 

But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press
Association, said that although it had considered running
the report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking
to the World Health Organization. 

""We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the
World Health Organization first,"" she said. ""They told us
that report was two years old, and had been covered at the
time. They said it had been picked up again that day by a
German news agency."" 

She added that she did not know which agency the
organization was referring to. 

Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California
at San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for
blond hair ""sounds patently incorrect.""

Bug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It's a pretty basic 
browser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified 
browsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 
and his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time 
slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance 
policy for regressions.

While this ""line in the sand"" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it 
misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to 
add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see 
features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, 
relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the 
user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last 
feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!

You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size 
requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious 
rule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says ""Capacity: 10 
people."" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of 
people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the 
second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it 
continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, 
but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of 
them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla 
sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes 
he'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. 
Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way 
to the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He 
doesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until 
eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.

We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that 
nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the 
features that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in 
Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want 
some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go 
download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat 
will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.

Eek.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that's a good idea. 
Outputting a message in %post and providing a README of some kind would
be better, as well as perhaps adding a note in %description.

802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range 
(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.

Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.

You are not still using sourceforge, are you? If you have any hopes that they 
are anything but yet another business giving away a free service, then see 
this: Selling Microsoft VisualStudio on the ""open source development platform"". 
Nice touch. Click on the image for the original screenshot....

Yes it does. And if you're missing the dependencies needed for the selected
options, you'll even be informed! (for ALSA, you'll need alsa-lib-devel for
example)

Yup... unfortunately the alsa-kernel needs to be rebuilt for each kernel,
and there's no way of avoiding it.

It still gets checked, but a negative score is added in.  And it doesn't
mean ""coming in from"" it means ""From: address is @yahoogroups.com"".
There's a Yahoo Groups compensation rule in 2.40 though. :)

ignored completely?  you can't do that, put in a procmail rule.

You'd want to either add your own compensation rule or up (negatively)
the whitelist score.

hmmm.

Peter.

Open a terminal and as root type
lsmod
you want to find a module called
NVdriver.

If it isn't loaded then load it.
#insmod NVdriver.o
Oh and ensure you have this module loaded on boot.... else when you reboot
you might be in for a nasty surprise.

Once the kernel module is loaded

#vim /etc/X11/XF86Config

in the section marked
Driver I have ""NeoMagic""
you need to have
Driver ""nvidia""

Here is part of my XF86Config

Also note that using the card you are using you 'should' be able to safely
use the FbBpp 32 option .

Are you kidding? It was fucking BRILLIANT. Do you know what exposure that got
them? They sat perfectly so that the cameras could focus on the mildly 
exasperated Rumsfeld and their ""UN Inspections not war"" banner. That picture
will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and 
France, at least. For goodness sakes, you're arguing about it on FoRK. In 
politics by sound-bite, those two rude hags kicked ass and took names.

For the record, I don't think they even got arrested, which is a shame. It
is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on the nightly
news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.

X-Spam-Level: 

This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and 
mh.

Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail 
server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn on that 
facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the 
stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to 
rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is 
unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the 
spool.

I had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:

1)  Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.  This 
means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "".  Any such line will 
look like "">From "".

2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect ""Content-length:"".  When I was 
having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, 
then nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but 
you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.

3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the 
whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and 
everything works.

Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built
against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/

What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red
Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching
alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the
dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure
--with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the
alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under
/tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"".

Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed
drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
kernel.

I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's
what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a
kernel recompiled with ACPI.

    Yeah, I need to work this out, too; I just learned my lesson about living on the bleeding edge. Lesson learned?  NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.

    Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.

    I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.  ""apt-get dist-upgrade"" dumps core.

    What's the inside secret here, or do I just start searching mirrors for the ISO and get over it?

Given current trends, particularly in demographics, such conflict won't
be military.  Europe wouldn't stand a chance now and things are getting
worse in a hurry.  They are SOL.

Not to mention that when push comes to shove they wouldn't stand united.

BTW, I've been thinking a little about the RPMs and other packages.
Already the PLD guys are distributing 3 rpms:

  - perl-Mail-SpamAssassin

          the perl modules.

  - spamassassin

          the ""spamassassin"" and ""spamd"" scripts,
          spamd rc-file etc.

  - spamassassin-tools

          mass-check, masses directory stuff, etc.
          for generating rescore data from corpora.

This seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needs
the perl modules doesn't need to require the full RPM be installed,
with RC files in init.d etc.

It's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.

Theo, BTW, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the RPM?

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2


Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.


Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written 
evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the 
infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is 
enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* 
FAQ) and ""eyewitness"" reporting without a single written source. What 
the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest 
attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much 
more skeptical if the ""quote"" emerged after his death... RK

===============================================================
http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm

""A billion here, a billion there . . .""

Did Dirksen ever say, "" A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon 
you're talking real money""? (or anything very close to that?)

Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio 
records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found 
no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to 
him.

Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics 
showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote 
or its variations.

Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed 
""Ev and Charlie"" and ""Ev and Jerry"" shows, all newspapers clippings in 
the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, 
transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of 
Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the 
Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.

Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to 
rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular 
turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or 
excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word ""pothole"" to 
remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to 
the debt ceiling:


""As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make 
the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were 
working on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got 
through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to 
the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic 
hazard.

""Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a 
conference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and 
said, ‘I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth 
and remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.'"" 
[Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].


On the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another ""spending"" story, 
one he labeled ""cat in the well"":


""One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story 
about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, ‘Johnny, a cat 
fell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and 
then fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the 
well?'

""Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a 
while, and then when the teacher came down and said, ‘How are you 
getting along?' Johnny said, ‘Teacher, if you give me another slate and 
a couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes 
I can land that cat in hell.'

""If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do 
not find much to cheer about concerning it."" [Congressional Record, June 
16, 1965, p. 13884].


But there are no such reminders for the ""A billion here, a billion 
there . . . "" tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's 
note-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt 
ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no 
authoritative reference to the ""billion"" phrase.

The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from 
people who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for 
example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as 
evidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard 
Dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But 
cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up 
nothing in the way of confirmation.

The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican 
leadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, ""The 
favorite sum of money is $1 billion – a billion a year for a fatter 
federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there."" [EMD Papers, 
Republican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the ""and pretty 
soon you're talking real money"" is missing.

In another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted 
Dirksen: ""Look at education – two-and-one-half billion – a billion for 
this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five 
billion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. 
You'll be deeply in the red."" [Cited in Byron Hulsey's ""Everett Dirksen 
and the Modern Presidents,"" Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of 
Texas, p. 226]

Of course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late 
Senator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not 
have his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional 
Records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and 
career – he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses 
claim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches 
tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated 
newspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, 
meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped 
capture.

Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have 
endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he 
ever coined it.

Subject: [Spambayes] Deployment
In-Reply-To: <w53lm6fca8i.fsf@woozle.org>
Message-ID: <GCEDKONBLEFPPADDJCOECEGMENAA.whisper@oz.net>

I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.

Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)

My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.

Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's

IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
n-way classifier uses something called a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM)
which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).

I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.

When posting to this list excerpts from books I've just read, I usually
refrain from adding any comments, letting the listmembers interpret them
as they see fit.

But since you asked....

I chose to post this text simply because I thought it was a particularly
risible example of Doyle's invincible faith and his refusal to accept the
fucking obvious.

This is my Netscape 7.0 Review.

o They finally got the email search speed back up to
   where it was in 4.7.x
o Setting up user mail accounts doesn't have that really
   odd, sometimes it lets me sometimes it doesn't problem that
   previous versions had.
o I still have to manually update all my address books by
   hand but at least it lets me import them as Netscape 4.x
   address books (there's not 6.x import as they just assume
   it works--which it doesn't)
o The mail filters are still broken and have the same problem that
   I've tried to report since 4.0.2 where you can't store a mail
   filter of the type: Age in days, is greater than, 21 (or some number)
   Gawd I'd really wish they'd fix that freakin' bug, it's the single
   biggest annoyance that I have with Netscape as it's one of the
   most effective anti-spam tools that I have.
o Webex doesn't support Netscape 7.0 and the plugin doesn't
   work which causes problems when you want to use Webex to
   work on something with someone remotely.

I've given up trying to report bugs and any changes to the
source I send always get lost.

--] Anyone heard of this law before?

Back when I was running the WSMF shoutcast server these restrictions were
just being placed on netcasters. Most folks laughed it off. Now with the
license fees its not laughable anymore. If you pay the fee you are bound
to the restrictions, if you dont your running the criminal line.

I still run a stream up on live365. Its been playing the same 10 hour
block of Jean Shepard shows for the last year. I really should change them
up.

If I were going to do the old WSMF shoutcast now adays I would either
spend lots of time going over regulations to see what I can or cannot do
or I would just chuck the regs out and do what I want. Or I might write
some apps to stay in regs ..I dont know..one thing is for sure it
defiently takes the spontaneous edge off things:)-

Do a wget of a file of known length, in a script that runs ""date"" before
and after (or equivalent).

Be aware that speed between you and your upstream link is one thing;
speed through countless congested routers to a faraway location may be
quite another.  Remember that hardware-level compression is a factor.
(The file you wget will probably be precompressed.)

In the area of the slightly more exotic, be aware that different traffic
may have higher priority and thus more available bandwidth at various
points in the transit to/from you -- and that some traffic may go via 
different paths coming vs. going.

Be aware that raw bulk transfer speed may not be the only thing that
matters:  Depending on what you're doing, the modem's connection latency
might matter, and this differs widely between modems.  (It matters more
for interactive sessions, e.g., ssh remote logins, where each keystroke
is echoed from remote.)

I have searched the list but did not find any info on this. 

How do I setup multiple spamd machines so that spamc load balances - or 
anything similar?

If I get troubles with the .tar.gz source file compilation, will it work 
with the .src.rpm source file compilation ?
If it will, how do I manage with a .src.rpm file, sorry, I don't remeber :(

That's what the manual said - a diversity antenna.

Why wouldn't it work well with one omni and one directional antena? 

IANAEE, but doesn't that count as diversity?

from their ""Explanation of Rates and Charges. ""Find Friends service will only

Thanks for this information.  I gave Alsa a try, couldn't figure out how
to enable digital out, although I'm sure if I put enough time into it,
could have gotten it working.  Also when playing mp3s in analog mode,
every time I switched between mp3s there was a bit of static.  Noticed a
new distribution geared towards audio applications, AGNULA
(http://www.agnula.org/) uses Alsa as well.  Seems though the latest
open source emu10k1 drivers (SBLive! 5.1) work fair enough.  Anyone else
experience these problems with Alsa?  Are there alot of people on this
list using Alsa?

Regards,

Lance

Subject: [zzzzteana] Frog Fall at Cheapside
Reply-To: zzzzteana@yahoogroups.com
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Near the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the
Madness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases
briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
""like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London.""

Was ""like a frog in Cheapside"" (or something similar) a catch phrase
itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?

And to what event or events does it refer?

I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch
Phrases.*

Thanks for the script.  It also appears that the standard logrotate tools
included with many systems (or at least RedHat systems) will support
wildcards when rotating files so something like
/home/*/.razor/razor-agent.log can be specified...

Hello fork,

  So they have Aaron Schwartz on NPR's Weekend Edition talking
  about Warchalking.   I'll agree, its funny, his voice is squeaky and
  I'm jealous that he got on radio and I didn't...

  But really, WTF is the big deal about warchalking?  I have yet to
  see any of it, anywhere.

  LInk will probably pop up on www.npr.org later today.

There must be *some* way of tracking a spammer down, since they are planning 
on making money from the spam.  What a court would consider evidence of being 
the spammer is another question.

One thing that's wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters.  Too many 
kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be 
influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I 
learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her 
own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's 
wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of 
individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending 
on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi 
come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a 
big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of 
the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
efficiently for how their kids are taught.

Hardware acceleration for SSL makes sense since PKI can slow down a
transaction by as much as 1,000-fold. Per this article, XML formatting only
increases doc size by about 20-fold.. I'm not sure there are enough ""powers
of ten"" in there to justify hardware acceleration. 

Expect the next major release from DataPower to be the revolutionary new
""email chip"" - allows you to offload the sending and receiving of email
messages onto dedicated hardware while you get on w/ more important things
.. like listening to MP3s..

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a

family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The

DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up

to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company

itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,

while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes

and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of

XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application

co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in

May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of

products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,

drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer

in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and

sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.

Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions

at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web

services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single

DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly

growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on

their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely

on XML for mission critical applications.""

They weren't partitioned in any particular scheme - I think I'll write a
reshuffler and move them all around, just in case (fwiw, I'm using MH

manipulate the sets.)

Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and
thursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.

The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed
last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh
come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it
ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story
lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the
enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to
have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.

But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would
rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign
on the old killsawfiles.

SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say
that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,
thier ""manager""*, for  pushing them to carry out their ""gay"" act far too
long and just when things look to be heating up with that story
arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces
that they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the
Bisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie
McMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first
lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.

Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this
around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier
way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be
edited much though from the way I heard it.

So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play
acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a
face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,
thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat
and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some
heat time would be good for him as a single.

All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4
year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on
borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no
longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?

Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz
and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.

* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.
Ricco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy
who goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.

Subject: Version 1.1.11 of the DCC

ersion 1.1.11 of the DCC source is in
http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/source/dccd.tar.Z and
http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/source/dccd.tar.Z

http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/dcc-tree/CHANGES and
http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/dcc-tree/CHANGES start with

    fix dccm bugs with handling a non-responsive server.
    change misc/hackmc to modify sendmail.cf to reject unauthorized relay
	attempts with a temporary failure when they are supposed to be sent
	to the DCC but dccm is not running.  This prevents leaking relay
	relay spam.  You must use the new hackmc script to install this
	change in sendmail.cf.
    remove ""# whitelisted"" from `cdcc stats` output to give more room
	for totals.
    prevent empty dccproc log files as noted by Krzysztof Snopek.
    even fatal errors should cause dccproc to exit with 0 to avoid
	rejecting mail, as noted by Krzysztof Snopek.
    When server hostnames have common IP addresses, prefer the server
	with the non-anonymous client-ID, noted by Krzysztof Snopek.

I need to experiment with ripping out all my ""sophisticated"" cut/paste
code.  This is mostly historical accident from dealing with very early
versions of Tk, and the emacs ""cutbuffer"", and other wierd junk.
You can, too, by hacking upon seditBind.tcl appropriately.

No need: All those components already exist either in the Java
class libraries or from the various java jar collections.  Most
of the classes I used came from the Jakarta project and ApacheXML

But if it's any consolation, my threading of them all together into
a newswire server /is/ GPL and available on sourceforge.

Using Razor2 via SpamAssasin.

System is Solaris 2.7, with qmail. Spamassassin run via user's procmail.
All users who use SA have run razor-register.

Razor2 is failing, and I can't find anything in the limited docs or on 
google on it,
and I'm hoping someone can help.

The error (which doesn't prevent SA from working) is:

Oct  2 06:38:22 sancho2 qmail: 1033565902.186041 delivery 4588: success: 
razor2_check_skipped:_Bad_file_number_Can't_locate_object_m
ethod_""new""_via_package_""Razor2::Client::Agent""_(perhaps_you_forgot_to_load_""Razor2::Client::Agent""?)_at_/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_p
erl/5.6.1/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm_line_374./did_0+0+1/

Looking at Dns.pm doesn't really help me, and Razor2::Client::Agent appears 
to be in the right place,
in /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Razor2/Client.

Ideas?

...Chris

The reason appears to be the Google cache feature. I can only imagine the
Internet Archive will soon follow, if it isn't already blocked.

Seems that governments do have some power over the Web, after all.

It's not the rpm, it's the rpm-system with you. The cache seems to have 
rottened. Try removing /var/lib/rpm/__db*

How were these msgs broken up into the 5 sets?  Set4 in particular is giving
the other sets severe problems, and Set5 blows the f-n rate on everything
it's predicting -- when the rates across runs within a training set vary by
as much as a factor of 25, it suggests there was systematic bias in the way
the sets were chosen.  For example, perhaps they were broken into sets by
arrival time.  If that's what you did, you should go back and break them
into sets randomly instead.  If you did partition them randomly, the wild
variance across runs is mondo mysterious.

Then you have to look at every message by eyeball -- any scheme has non-zero
error rates of both kinds.

Trust me <wink> -- it helps a *lot*.  I expect everyone who has done any
testing here has discovered spam in their ham, and vice versa.  Results
improve as you improve the categorization.  Once the gross mistakes are
straightened out, it's much less tedious to scan the rest by eyeball.

For whatever reason, there appear to be few of those in BruceG's spam
collection.  I added code to strip uuencoded sections, and pump out uuencode
summary tokens instead.  I'll check it in.  It didn't make a significant
difference on my usual test run (a single spam in my Set4 is now judged as
ham by the other 4 sets; nothing else changed).  It does shrink the database
size here by a few percent.  Let us know whether it helps you!

Well, DUH!!!

It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,
precisely identical between males and females.

Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.

I've been in Austin all weekend. On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas 
about EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he 
blogged the hell out of the talk: 

    Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano 
    roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!),

Well, I think my avifile build still needs the win32 codecs to be able to
run (manually copied into /usr/lib/win32/), but personally, I've been very
happy with mplayer's default (which is ffmpeg's ffdivx decoder) for nearly
all the DivX files I used. The only ones that still require (from my own
experience) the use of the win32 codecs are the ones encoded with a strange
DivX 3 sound format... and I've really not seen any quality or speed
improvements when using them.

See the checkin comments for timtest.py last night.  Adding this code gave a
major reduction in the false negative rate:

def crack_content_xyz(msg):
    x = msg.get_type()
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-type:' + x.lower()

    x = msg.get_param('type')
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-type/type:' + x.lower()

    for x in msg.get_charsets(None):
        if x is not None:
            yield 'charset:' + x.lower()

    x = msg.get('content-disposition')
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-disposition:' + x.lower()

    fname = msg.get_filename()
    if fname is not None:
        for x in fname.lower().split('/'):
            for y in x.split('.'):
                yield 'filename:' + y

    x = msg.get('content-transfer-encoding:')
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-transfer-encoding:' + x.lower()


...

    t = ''
    for x in msg.walk():
        for w in crack_content_xyz(x):
            yield t + w
        t = '>'

I *suspect* most of that stuff didn't make any difference, but I put it all
in as one blob so don't know which parts did and didn't help.

It could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun 
JDK.

Nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation.  

Is the use of ""trusted hardware"" really worth it ?  Does it really make it 
more secure ?  Look at the DVDs.

Ah, but you've just gotten to the crux of the
situation.  There's good design and bad design. 
There's good testing and bad testing.  The problem
is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody
does.  I think ""best practices"" hasn't caught up
on main street Web enablement yet.  There's some
really great packages on how to do this stuff and
in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed
to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms
and  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and
people usually do.  What the problem is, they don't
even recognize that they're gimpy--ever.  They just
keeping trundling along making a mess of everything
assured in their job security that they can build
Web forms without even caring if they can be
used or not beyond their test machine.

If you had a piece of software and a security warning
came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?
Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally
broken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know
is why would someone use Web forms best practices from
5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that
time.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows
or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window
manager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for
a brief period of time, but they are completely useless
except for some terminal based replacement applications. 

The bottom line is, if you can't get across the
bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault
it really is, and it's the business that 
needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that
wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

The total collections are 1100 messages.  I trained with 1100/5

I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.

Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.

So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:

class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):

    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }

    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)

This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.

It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).

One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:

> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science student

I guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.

Sony makes such a line of products.

My father was legendary for his abilty to break things.  His 'thumbs of death'
would rival anything a toddler could do to devices.  After countless numbers of
Walkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion I
found the Sony devices.  I got him a ""My First Sony"" (be afraid of the
marketing) CD player.   It was /fire engine red/ but was completely
indestructible.  I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him.  He
complained of it's looks but used it nonetheless.  I also gave him a pack of
headphones as there's no such things indestuctible headphones that aren't
obscenely bulky.

Now that we're riding up the curve of an ever increasing geezer population, how
soon before device makers get wise?  Not to be morbid, but would the marketing
be ""My Last Sony""?  <ducks and runs>

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
citizen is violating US law.

The first court cases were actually concluded years ago. These 
include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
rights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to 
spammers.

Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
heard of PopLaunch, right?)

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a 
pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:

http://belps.freewebsites.com/

I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:

http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm

Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.

Well, you could damn well get a fucking better attitude.
I practically handed you a job the other week and you

""x"" is fine, but let's not take out the config option.  if people really
want to have it be something else, we shouldn't hinder them.

This may be a systematic bias in the testing procedure:  in real life, msgs
come ordered in time.  Say there's a thread that spans N messages on c.l.py.
In our testing setup, we'll train on a random sampling throughout its whole
lifetime, and test likewise.  New ham ""in the middle"" of this thread gets
benefit from that we trained on msgs that appeared both before and *after*
it in real life.  It's quite plausible that the f-p rate would rise without
this effect; in real life, at any given time some number of ham threads will
just be starting their lives, and if they're at all unusual the trained data
will know little to nothing about them.

i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?

anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.

Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it.  So we popped it onto a box
downstairs and wow - it is fast.  Comes with some lovely client tools
also.  Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
triggers.

IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.  Free single
developer license downloadable from their website.

Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek sculptor behind the plan, judged that the
 limestone of Mount Kerdylio, 70 miles east of Salonika and not far from the
 Mount Athos monastic community, was ideal for the patriotic sculpture. 
 
 As well as Alexander's granite features, 240 ft high and 170 ft wide, a
 museum, a restored amphitheatre and car park for admiring crowds are
planned
---------------------
So is this mountain limestone or granite?
If it's limestone, it'll weather pretty fast.

Hi Matthias,

I think I could do help you out with new plugins package for gkrellm 2. 
Would you prefer to keep it as it is now, or package every plugin
separately?  The latter would be probably easier to maintain.

Wanadoo.fr is notorious for being unresponsive to spam abuse

That shrinks to under 2 million bytes, though, if I delete all the WordInfo
records with spamprob exactly equal to UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB.  Such records
aren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of
UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB).  Such records are only needed for training; I've noted
before that a scoring-only database can be leaner.

In part the bloat is due to character 5-gram'ing, part due to that the
database is brand new so has never been cleaned via clearjunk(), and part
due to plain evil gremlins.

Yesterday Viridiana came to my place and dragged me out to look at the sky. It 
was beautiful. Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today 
Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). 
Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much 
street light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from 
NASA...

If we ever <wink> have a shared corpus, an easy refactoring of timtest
should allow to plug in different tokenizers.  I've only made three changes
to Graham's algorithm so far (well, I've made dozens -- only three survived
testing as proven winners), all the rest has been refining the tokenization
to provide better clues.

That's ambiguous.  Accuracy rates or error rates, ham or spam rates?

Mining embedded http/https/ftp thingies cut the false negative rate in half
in my tests (not keying off href, just scanning for anything that ""looked
like"" one); that was the single biggest f-n improvement I've seen.  It
didn't change the false positive rate.  So you know whether src added
additional power, or did you do both at once?

Most likely in the added overhead of managing more sequences.

I'm sure it can be tuned a bunch, but as I'm leaving for a vacation on Friday, 
and have plenty of ""real work"" to do, I won't be able to do much until I get 
back.

I *will* look at all this when I get back, but if you want to check into 
what's slow and fix things while I'm gone, my feelings won't be hurt.

  | I can't reproduce this error.

For me it is very repeatable... (like every time, without fail).

This is the debug log of the pick happening ...

18:19:03 Pick_It {exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace} {4852-4852 -sequence mercury}
18:19:03 exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace 4852-4852 -sequence mercury
18:19:04 Ftoc_PickMsgs {{1 hit}}
18:19:04 Marking 1 hits
18:19:04 tkerror: syntax error in expression ""int ...

Note, if I run the pick command by hand ...

delta$ pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace  4852-4852 -sequence mercury
1 hit

That's where the ""1 hit"" comes from (obviously).  The version of nmh I'm
using is ...

delta$ pick -version
pick -- nmh-1.0.4 [compiled on fuchsia.cs.mu.OZ.AU at Sun Mar 17 14:55:56 ICT 2002]

And the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...

delta$ mhparam pick
-seq sel -list


Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

kre

ps: this is still using the version of the code form a day ago, I haven't
been able to reach the cvs repository today (local routing issue I think).

_Law.com_: Suit Over Airlines' Web Sites Tests Bounds of ADA[1]. [via Slashdot: 
Blind User Sues Southwest Over Web Site, Cites ADA[2]] 

    Gumson and a Miami Beach, Fla.- based disability rights group, Access Now, 
    filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Miami in June and July against 
    Dallas- based Southwest and Dallas-based American Airlines under the 
    Americans with Disabilities Act. They are doing so under an untested legal 
    theory. Namely, that ADA provisions on the accessibility of public 
    accommodations to the disabled apply to Internet Web sites just as they do 
    to brick-and-mortar facilities like movie theaters and department stores. 

Five months ago, I said[3] &#8220;within the next 12 months, all web authoring 
tools will fully embrace CSS, accessibility, and web standards. And I mean 
fully, inside and out, as Macromedia appears to have done here [with 
Dreamweaver MX]. Those tools that do not will simply fall by the wayside. This 
is the new baseline.&#8221; Seven months to go on that prediction. Tick tock, 
tick tock...

Yeah, I learned by hearing exmh users scream in agony.  Sorry about
all that.  We should be able to clean this up.  If you grep for
""bind"" in seditBind you quickly find the Text_Selection proc
I described in the previous email.

- Presuming your run Bash  :
Note the directory lists 
#  perl -e 'map { print ""$_\n"" } @INC'
Then set up the Shell variable PERL5LIB variable (and put it in some .bashrc 
for future use)
# export PERL5LIB=""directory1:directory2:directory3:directory4""
Then try to install the software

PERL5LIB is explained perlrun(1) : do 
# man perlrun for more information

Especially good for student access machines at libraries, etc.

Shelley Powers raises[1] some interesting questions re whether RDF has a place 
in syndication. She says that RDF is trying to build a persistent database (aka 
the Semantic Web) and RSS is trying to flow news that has a short lifespan. I 
had not heard this point before. It's worth thinking about.

Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or
device drivers - C still rules the world.

The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

It seems that something changed during the last 3-4 weeks.

1) In a folder, msgs 1-n is read, n=current, n upwards is unread.
2) change to another folder
3) change back to the original folder and you'll see msg n+1 being 
highlighted as current for a split second, that it changes back to 
n=current.

Kind of annoying since it marks msg n+1 as read.

Hardware acceleration for SSL makes sense since PKI can slow down a
transaction by as much as 1,000-fold. Per this article, XML formatting only
increases doc size by about 20-fold.. I'm not sure there are enough ""powers
of ten"" in there to justify hardware acceleration. 

Expect the next major release from DataPower to be the revolutionary new
""email chip"" - allows you to offload the sending and receiving of email
messages onto dedicated hardware while you get on w/ more important things
.. like listening to MP3s..

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a

family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The

DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up

to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company

itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,

while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes

and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of

XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application

co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in

May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

========================================================================
=

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of

products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,

drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer

in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and

sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.

Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions

at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web

services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single

DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly

growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on

their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely

on XML for mission critical applications.""

Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
But that obscures the different modes of
promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
money or power or companionship and the person
who uses money and power and companionship to
get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.

Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.

Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)

There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT 
listers were approached by him (via email) - a little research in 
dejanews/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly 
hoping to contact girls, appearing in ""alt.teens"" and similar groups -
 I just tried a Google Groups search on ""Robert Moaby"" and some of 
them came top of the list.

Note for Marie - ""MT"" stands for Mark Thomas, a slightly slimmer, UK 
version of your Michael Moore - the mailing list is named after him.

So some guy failed to reach the source, but instead got spin doctor to
deny it.  Wot, is he thick enough to expect official confirmation
that, yes, Blair is going around casting aspersions on Bush???

It's an amusing anecdote, I don't know if it's true or not, but certainly
nothing here supports the authoritative sounding conclusion ""Status: False"".

&check now un-defangs MIME -- it was screwing up some of my mass-check

If there ever was a warning about SA-markup in mass-check, it never

Subject: [zzzzteana] US Army tests portable translator
Reply-To: zzzzteana@yahoogroups.com

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stm

US soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,""
said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published
recently. 

The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding
itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. 

Speaking in tongues 

""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" Robert
Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital. 

 
Translators could be essential for US soldiers
 
""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart. 

""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them,"" he said. 

The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially
available laptops. 

The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.
So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. 

Slow system 

For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who
knew just a smattering of English. 

The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated
into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. 

""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it was
slow in translating phrases. 

The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field. 

But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development. 

The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between
the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon
University.

Heh. I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors
buy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each, but there are chipsets and
drives with known DMA issues as well.

Usually if you enable DMA on a CDROM that can't handle it gracefully you
won't be able to read data off it relably, and that's about it. No
end_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.

> I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting

My biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always
seem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same
box, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in
""kudzu-speak"". I agree that the %description is the best place for the
tip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to
divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or
having that media currently in the drive.

Thanks Matthias.  Actually I got all four speakers with subwoofer
working in digital out mode with gamixer.
(http://www1.tcnet.ne.jp/fmurata/linux/down/)

However switching between analog and digital, I'm still baffled.  As I
have a tuner and cassette deck hooked up to ""Line In"" on a SBLive! 5.1,
which is in analog mode.  But digital out works great now!

An apparent quote from Dubya, from the Times (sent to me by my Dad):

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.

Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

Oh, neat.

I have similiar thing in my hands, though it might be migratable if I
had the time to try. I've been using another 6.x repository though.
http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/apt

Anyone tried (dist-)upgrade from 6.x to 7? Theoretically it should drop
in some -compat's (notably libc) and upgrade the rest and after a reboot
and maybe a new kernel (and grub, but I have long before put those to
v6's :) run just fine. Haven't had a spare machine to try it on myself,
though.

What do you mean by ""CD-Key or the like"" (I presume that ""of"" was a
typo)? And what do you mean by ""unbreakable""?

You need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to
solve, and about the constraints involved.

Some general points:

1. For a conventional ""CD key"" system, where the actual CDs are
mass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire
system has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys
being ""traded"" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the
product).

If there's an online element involved, you can ""tie"" keys to a
specific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP's
""product activation"".

2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be
vulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within
the executable.

3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to
""cracking"", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the
validation checks.

This can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a
Palladium-style system).

Most significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only
accessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a
meaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts
and discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).

IOW, you have to ""keep the genie in the bottle"" at all times. If the
data can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated
hardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and
distributed without limit.

I run exmh routinely from home (broadband) using an XWindows Client tunneled through ssh under <ahem> WinXP.  It works very well in this fashion.

FWIW, I use Eudora under Winder$ because it's less of a virus magnet.  :)

There's more to the story why I run Winder$, but that's really off-topic and I'm already guilty!

Hi,

Just the kind of announce I make once in a while :
- I've rebuilt a new ""alsaplayer"" package based on Angle's one.
- I've rebuilt a hopefully final version ""-fr8"" of the ""alsa-driver"" and
  ""alsa-kernel"" packages which fix all known SMP build issues.

Both can be found here :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/

I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/

Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of ""--with ldap"", ""--with mysql"" and ""--with
postgres"" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.
http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))

I think I'll use this ""--with <whatever>"" switch more and more where
possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its
output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec
to enable Pilot support.

As usual, feedback and comments are welcome! :-)

Matthias

PS: Yup, I'm back from my holidays ;-)

I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.

Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).

Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.

So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

-Ian.

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

=========================================================================

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

By ""meanings have evolved"" do you [or they] mean that the Hebrew words
have changed meaning or that our understanding of the Hebrew words have
changed? Or do they posit a pre-Mosaic form of the laws that had
evolved by time of the Pentateuch?

> In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was

This seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the
Hebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg
Gen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.

In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar
claim about the ""real"" meaning of one of the ten commandments:

""""""
> The translations since cause problems at each successive remove

We have the original language versions, though, so this is not an
issue.

> I'm sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment
> is 'thou shalt not murder' rather than 'kill,'

This has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on our
knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word ""ratsach"". Most modern
translations I've seen translate it ""murder"" but elsewhere the word is
used
of an animal killing a human (something for which most English speakers
wouldn't use the word ""murder"").

My concern doesn't stem from failing to understand how your business is
intended to work.  My concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it
will reduce the amount of uncaught spam.

Please don't misquote me.  I did not assert that you ""can't track
spammers"".  Here is what I said:

| It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in
| various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good
| example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.

I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that
does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox.  It is
an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient
to counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to
avoid being tagged as spam.

I think I've worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a
score.  I'm just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle
for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.

I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive
score (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone's
inbox) and after we've seen evidence that the system works, then we can
increase the magnitude of the score.

Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...

A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?


http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html


Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.

Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.

Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.

The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.

He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.

""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""

The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.

His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.

She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt.""

Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
that morning.

He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you.""

Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.

If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.

Hi,

Thank you for the useful replies, I have found some interesting 
tutorials in the ibm developer connection.

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec1

and

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec2

Registration is needed.

I will post the same message on the Web Application Security list, as 
suggested by someone.

For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the 
approach described in secure programmin fo linux and unix how-to).

I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its 
implementation at anytime.

Thank you again!

Mario Torre

It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail?  ""Insecure dependency"" screams ""I'm in taint mode!"", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).

If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put ""DROPPRIVS=3Dyes""
in the procmailrc. :)

Is it possible to use new apt to do (null) to RH8 upgrade?

Even if it's possible, are there good reasons why maybe I should not do it and
just use the RH iso's (I don't think RH8 will upgrade from (null), maybe up2date
will)?

X-Spam-Level: 

I've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here's the 
behaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I 
also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh 
window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select 
it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the 
recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and 
leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no 
longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this 
behaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what 
I paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more 
specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:

Application       What gets pasted

XEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh
xterm             same as XEmacs
AbiWord           nothing
Nedit             nothing
sedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwritten

The last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then 
obviously that's what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets 
pasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted 
and typed over (I have ""Type Kills SEL"" on.).

It seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to 
paste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??

Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: 
""ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 2.""

I could think of a solution: We could remove the ""use"" line and add the 
version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines 
  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; 
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
Makefile.PL` will die with a ""Uncaught exception from user code: 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 103."" there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if 
CPAN will run the make anyway...

We could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean 
approach but could work. 
 
We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We 
already have a useless line ""pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made"" there. Adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings (""Makefile:933: 
warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: 
ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'"") but does work. Not a very good 
solution either.

The ""use MakeMaker::..."" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA 
installation. But that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know.

DOOM 3 will use P2P System?

           Ant writes ""From Page 6 of FiringSquad's
           QuakeCon 2002 Postmortem article: John Carmack said
           something at the end of the Q&A about how the
           multiplayer will be only four players? Tim: After 2 hours of
           talking up at the podium, sometimes you leave a few details
           out. Doom 3 multiplayer will be fully scalable. It will be a
           peer to peer system. We haven't started working on it yet.
           Tell everyone not to panic - it will be fine. John just forgot
           to mention it'll be scalable past four players. It's hard to
           give a hard number because we haven't started working on
           it yet. Right now we're focused on making Doom 3 a
           kickass, over the top single player game.""

I love the absurd sense of humor it takes to build up such an elaborate 
evening only to note that ""even if the date's a bust you can always have 
a hundred people up for cocktails"" in your penthouse suite at the end of 
the night :-)

Personally, I'd put one point in favor of the Redwood Room over Lapis: 
on a weeknight, you can still whip out a TiBook and write, since it's a 
hotel bar. And it seems to give people all sorts of license to 
interrogate you as to why you're writing with a double of scotch :-)

Sure - discussion in Forbes - rigorous research, that. Especially when 
the data in their own list
contradicts them. I continue to look at the list and all the ""inherited,

I read it enough times my vision will clear.

I, at on point, looked into Stanford Business School. After learning 
that tuition was > 20K,
no financial aid was available, and part-time work was disallowed, this 
smart person decided
that I was not willing to spend the $150 application fee 
(non-refundable). During attendance at
my local business school, I was told repeatedly I should have gone for 
it - to quote a prof, (Northwestern MBA), it
has nothing to do with the education you receive - in general European 
(and Canadian) business
schools are better and more innovative - its the connections. He used 
the words ""American nobility.""

""invented"" being the right word. Dubya went to Yale and HBS. I guess

Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent 
study found that college graduates
earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). 
They did decline to mention
that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of
them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - 
the average salary for
a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 
21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder
half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call 
centers that
have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some 
entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an
hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 
1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference
is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other 
words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, 
 union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument 
to this is that many college graduates
 leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is 
that we are the thin edge
(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of 
third-world wages and work practices coming
 to North America.

I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they 
could maintain that (and prosper) just says
 volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people 
there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote
with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large 
employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway
eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired 
employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were
that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of 
rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed
 a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, 
guess what - used to be a VP at the company.
That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - 
as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long
as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in 
place.

And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of 
some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,
are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received 
generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about
the labor markets here.

Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I 
have difficulty finding any - except of course for
labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well 
unless the supply is tight)
It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the 
self-made billionaires on
the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the 
concept of ""more stuff, cheaper""
which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly 
galling example is
high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that 
it is an area where the pricing
approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the 
telecom industry (maintain your
monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through 
the same regulators) meet.
Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole 
entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing
seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer 
seems less important than using
regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to 
produce profits for the favored few.

I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like 
they're the biggest believers in
the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the 
rights of that ""proletariat"" you've
just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital 
in the hands of a few (ideally people
who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, 
and lie - use
the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain 
amount of poverty reduction actually
helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the 
Republic party seems to be the more homeless under
 each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.

And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining 
standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,
greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the 
work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right
 to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining 
standards of living) is the reality.

Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - 
the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:

""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to 
the top 20% of households""

That 1 is unneeded and is probably whats upsetting your kernel

we use ""console=ttyS0,9600n8"" but the 9600 is mainly cos we are a cisco
shop and its to keepo everyhting the same.

Close encounter of burnt kind

IT came from outer space ­ or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation ­ that the
odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed ­ because
it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
surface,"" she said.
After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
the object for authenticity.
If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
auction.
She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.""
But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
academic caution.
""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said.
""They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
around the edge.
""Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
smallest that they usually appear.""
To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have
to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
being extra-terrestrial are slim.
""Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
""However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,""
he added.

Horrors. Applets are kinda sucky. The cool kids are using Java to write
server applications, not browser craplets.

The giggle-inducing irony of the whole Java thing is how Sun's strategy
backfired. They produced a platform that was supposed to dwell on the
client side, where it would commoditize those clients. Instead, it turns
out to be the perfect language to write server applications in, and it has
successfully commoditized servers. Ooops!

Except that parroting the party line doesn't really require much
freedom of speech. Now if you had posted something from a left of

HHS Seeks Science Advice to Match Bush Views

By Rick Weiss
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, September 17, 2002; Page A01

The Bush administration has begun a broad restructuring of the
scientific advisory committees that guide federal policy in areas such
as patients' rights and public health, eliminating some committees
that were coming to conclusions at odds with the president's views and
in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices.

I've just installed SpamAssassin and relevant modules.
Just tried the initial test: 

spamassassin -t < sample-nonspam.txt > nonspam.out

and got back:

Broken Pipe

I've also tried using the -P and --pipe option but to
no avail.

Any help greatly appreciated. BTW - I'm no great Perl

The actual follow-up to the Xing player break was more interesting than
that.  The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input and
output) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly
designed systems and/or algorithm. The primary reason it was easy for
CSS is because the CSS key was only 40-bits, and thereby easy to break
with exhaustive search attacks.  It was only 40-bits (speculated)
because of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export
rules at the time.

Even more interesting, to me at least, was that soon after the Xing
player break, people started studying the CSS algorithm itself.  They
rapidly found serious design flaws which left the 40-bit CSS algorithm
with an actual strength of around 23-bits (from memory, and new attacks
might have further reduced the strength).  This is another great example
showing why proprietary cryptography algorithms should be viewed with
the greatest of suspicion.

Yes and no.  You can put a limited amount of trust in a smart card.
There have been any number of very clever attacks against smartcards
(Ross Anderson in the UK has documented quite a few of these), and
smartcard manufactures are usually one step behind these attacks.  A
well designed system assumes that a system smartcard will be completely
compromised at some point, giving an adversary all of the secrets
contained in the smartcard.  The cryptography industry has developed a
variety of techniques that can reduce the impact of a compromise,
including unique keys per smartcard and forward security techniques.

Going back to the original question, once the encrypted material goes
outside the trusted hardware, it is impossible to ""unbreakably"" protect
it.  There may be some mitigation steps you can take, such as the SDMI
watermarking, but most schemes to date have been easily broken.  

Another consideration is the value of what you are trying to protect.
While there is no such thing as unbreakable, adding more cost (both in
terms of price and hassle-factor) can greatly improve the protection.
Since you are talking about the use of standard PC workstations, I
presume what you are trying to protect is not THAT valuable.  I'm afraid
most security measures don't come for free.

For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python or
java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO.

I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it's
dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product,
written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is important
IP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not an
option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.

Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of ""oops,
there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop
around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got,
rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best"".

This can be a *very* big deal, for obvious reasons ;)    Open source
knockers should note that this is not a problem when using LGPL'd libs ;)

Moller, a public company in Davis, California, has developed a flying car.  

    [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/flyingcar.jpg] Moller International 
    has developed the first and only feasible, personally affordable, personal 
    vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle the world has ever seen. 

    You've always known it was just a matter of time before the world demanded 
    some kind of flying machine which would replace the automobile. Of course, 
    this machine would have to be capable of VTOL, be easy to maintain, cost 
    effective and reliable. Well, we at Moller International believe we have 
    come up with the solution. That solution is the volantor named M400 Skycar.

On my box the current system scores about 50 msgs per second (starting in
memory, of course).  While that can be a drag while waiting for one of my
full test runs to complete (one of those scores a message more than 120,000
times, and trains more than 30,000 times), I've got no urge to do any speed
optimizations -- if I were using this for my own email, I'd never notice the
drag.  Guido will bitch like hell about waiting an extra second for his
50-msg batches to score, but he's the boss so he bitches about everything
<wink>.

I haven't profiled yet, but *suspect* there aren't any egregious hot spots.
5-gram'ing of long words with high-bit characters is likely overly expensive
*when* it happens, but it doesn't happen that often, and as an approach to
non-English languages it sucks anyway (i.e., there's no point speeding
something that ought to be replaced entirely).

A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. 

The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. 

The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. 

The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" 

Mom fainted.

Ah, sorry for not making that clearer.
But no.
Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point while
it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.

Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
must be something else that I am missing...

Does this fork+exec a perl interpreter for every incoming mail? If so, I 
reckon your mailer is vulerable to a DoS attack without too much effort...
The real question is: is there a way to run razor without this overhead?  
Even some sort of razord you could talk to over a unix socket would do.
Until I can find one, I cannot spare the resources to run razor at all :(

Say 'amen' somebody. What the WSJ said, appended below.


The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,
expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at
the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the ""good""
of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else
to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized
crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest
nation.

Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago
have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally
irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in
government.

As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly
usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will
be ""granted"" away  in a potlatch that only government, and
special-interest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the
cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize
to such perfection.


All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded
by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not
religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name.
*Commerce*.


If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites
who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects
on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called
""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the
highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,
foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.

If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for
a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the
families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the
property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the
event.

And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as
tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square
feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.


In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic
internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially
decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,
economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition
and statism.

It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower
Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but
it's going to happen sooner or later.

And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who
died at the World Trade Center.

Cheers,
RAH

The Wall Street Journal

September 11, 2002
REVIEW & OUTLOOK

A Living Memorial

As we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the
six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone
else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who
died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who
perished would be a living one.

The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,
especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of
heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of
the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were
attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best
expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be
to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries
working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of
productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin
Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.

But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has
been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous
rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the
Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and
scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now
clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,
and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance
to rebuild a better, more prosperous city.

This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out
what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor
George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November
re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the
memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the
commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space
for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning
to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so
successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for
an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.

A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's
anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They
want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas
- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have
had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in
New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World
Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are
cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own
anti-development agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. One
family group even called a press conference to reject as
disrespectful a proposed train line under the site.

We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident
that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center
isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great
cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all
rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban
life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port
city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a
statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.

In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to
be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were
affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,
you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary
War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World
War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it
disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on
around the walls containing their names.

In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the
emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future.
Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres
devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures
on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would
severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised
his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the
press and has since ducked for cover.

Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe
those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking
more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best
way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.

Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation

By Dan Gillmor
Mercury News Technology Columnist

The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy
industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify
soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.

Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial
and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what
everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.

The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal
administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed
supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after
California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity
generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,
also driving up prices.

And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked
the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a
memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to
relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any
congestion.''

How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be
seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and
policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.

More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --
including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers'
grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think
that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least
favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of
traditional, non-renewable energy sources.

If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any
fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the
state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a
reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.

State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.
Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if
it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the
utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,''
notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).

It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --
tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could
achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better
job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to
inject real competition into the market.

We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity
defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation
is essential.

But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers
control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of
both.

The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up
the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities
will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable
sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.

But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer
model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer
ideas isn't enough.

The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small
generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,
harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is
coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.

Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.
California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax
incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't
done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did
react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's
lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it
altogether.

Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so
grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are
making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming
war in Iraq goes badly.

It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to
drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy
system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its
own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it
hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next
year.

I finally let go of my Irix Magic desktop and window manager
and evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 years
of customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one point
at UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached to
another WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I
had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view 
desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this along
with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],
I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  

After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am
really enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frills
first look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]
but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,
(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  The
number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] After
less than an hour or two of ""nesting"" I already have almost
all my menus and controls setup just the way I want. 

I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It's
a great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite the
bullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine.

Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now
e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give
it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
Outlook.

When we get more (good) ""nice"" tests, the GA will assign lower
scores to them.  I think the current problem is that there are
very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots
of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big
problem to solve.

I wouldn't say that the societies of humans here before European occupancy
was 'lifted' by free xyz. Perhaps 'replaced' or 'sunk' or some other
description, but not 'lifted'. Also, the lifestyle of the remnants of those
societies is on average only marginally above poverty even today.

The new ish of Strange Horizons in out, with an interview with Bloodhag, the 
most metal of the all the science fiction metal bands. 

    Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone. 
    ""This is Frank Bellknap Long!"" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a 
    lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on 
    this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English 
    Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, 
    and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his 
    head and belts out the song in a growling voice that's monster-movie low. 
    ""No reason! No corners!"" he shouts. Two minutes later, they're done with 
    the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. ""Our next song is about 
    Harlan Ellison!"" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, 
    and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy. 

    Blöödhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing 
    themselves as ""edu-core,"" the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash 
    tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the 
    audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands 
    that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: ""The Faster You Go 
    Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read.""

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others at the O'Reilly OS X con have tracked 
down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network here -- every 
20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages from your 
browser and other net-utilities. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Don't do the 
brown WiFi, the brown WiFi is BAD (_Thanks, Rob!_)

This is what cvs puts in when you modify the copy of the file on your disk
and someone checks in a change and then you pull an update and cvs can't
figure out how to merge your changes and the checked in changes. The lines
between the <<<<<< and the ===== are in your file and the ones in the next
section are what have been checked in. You must have not noticed the warning
messages about conflicts that cvs gave you when you did the update, and the
""C"" flag next to that file when cvs listed the files being pulled.

How about your local pub?

(sorry couldn't resist)

I still use Live365; slowly the disconnected stations are returning,
since the fee to stay on the air can be as low as $6/month, and if
your fave broadcaster won't pay, you're given the option to pay for
them.

Sending mail directly to a backup mail server in the hopes that it has
less stringent spam scanning is a common spammer trick.

Dan Gillmor's column this week is all about Apple's burgeoning resistance to 
the Hollywood onslaught on general-purpose computing: 

    Intel's doing it. Advanced Micro Devices is doing it. Microsoft is doing 
    it. 

    Apple Computer isn't. 

    What's Apple not doing? It's not -- at least so far -- moving toward an 
    anti-customer embrace with Hollywood's movie studios and the other members 
    of the powerful entertainment cartel.

What I meant was that neither he nor anyone else has any *authority* to 
say something can or can't be published, and make that stick, at least 
in the US, and from some descriptions, France. Of course he can say 
anything he wants. And I can choose to ignore it, or not. Works both 
ways.

Fscking semantics.

Dan Gillmor interviewed Jack Valenti[1] last week in his column and did the 
impartial thing, representing Valenti's beliefs as fairly as possible. This 
week, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda 
really entails: 

    So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another 
    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to 
    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that 
    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't 
    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants 
    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used 
    to violate copyrights. 

    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the 
    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask 
    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep 
    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing 
    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a 
    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after 
    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some 
    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. 
    Saying it doesn't make it so.

So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed by
one of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities of
water spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, the
toilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilet
had cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.

So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what
are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain
bowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with
a sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent
past -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone I
know. The guts, yeah, they fail all the time. But the storage bowl -- never.

Geesh.

Trust me, you do *not* want to running your own mailing lists
on your own software.

You'll wind up crying in a dark room looking for something
high-voltage to stick your fingers into.

You need to install the ""glut"" package from Red Hat Linux 8.0 (and
""glut-devel"" if you intend to recompile the source rpm).

Here you need both ""aalib"" and ""lirc"" from freshrpms.net. They're small,
they can be quite useful, that's why I've compiled xine with them as a
default.
You should be able to get rid of those two though, by rebuilding the source
rpm (otherwise it's a bug in my packaging!) :
rpmbuild --rebuild --without aalib --without lirc xine*.src.rpm

We're in violent agreement there:  the comments in tokenizer.py say that as
strongly as possible, and I've repeated it endlessly here too.  But so long
as I was the only one doing serious testing, it was a dubious idea to make
the code maximally clumsy for me to use on the c.l.py task <wink>.

Yup, the system picks up on *everything* in the tokens.  Graham's proposed
""delete as ham"" and ""delete as spam"" keys would probably work very well for
motivated geeks.  But Paul Svensson has pointed out here that they probably
wouldn't work nearly so well for real people.

I'll soon check in this change:

    def tokenize_body(self, msg, retain_pure_html_tags=False):
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        """"""Generate a stream of tokens from an email Message.

        If a multipart/alternative section has both text/plain and text/html
        sections, the text/html section is ignored.  This may not be a good
        idea (e.g., the sections may have different content).

        HTML tags are always stripped from text/plain sections.

        By default, HTML tags are also stripped from text/html sections.
        However, doing so hurts the false negative rate on Tim's
        comp.lang.python tests (where HTML-only messages are almost never
        legitimate traffic).  If optional argument retain_pure_html_tags
        is specified and True, HTML tags are retained in text/html sections.
        """"""

You should do a cvs up and establish a new baseline first, as I checked in a
pure-win change in the wee hours that cut the fp and fn rates in my tests.

Absolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about 
life on Earth today.

The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy 
that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in 
an imperfect world.

I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa, 
our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in 
practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in 
Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and 
taking share from every other government broadcaster.

It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term 
as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.

Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly 
centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: 
ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic 
platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared 
they might.

As you read, replace ""United States"" with ""Roman Empire"" and it may make 
as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be 
about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President 
might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to 
our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations 
overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on 
how engaged we are in the world around us.

Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the 
globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research 
stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all 
the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.

Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the 
real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. 
I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit 
such a principle to be loosed upon the world.

Full Text: Bush's National Security Strategy

Following is the full text of President Bush's new national security 
strategy. The document, entitled ""The National Security Strategy of the 
United States,"" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of 
the Administration's policy.

INTRODUCTION

THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and 
totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of 
freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, 
democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only 
nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and 
guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the 
potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People 
everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; 
worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own 
property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom 
are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of 
protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of 
freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.

Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military 
strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our 
heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for 
unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that 
favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies 
can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and 
economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the 
world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace 
against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace 
by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the 
peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.

Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental 
commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed 
dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great 
industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of 
individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less 
than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to 
penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies 
against us.

To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- 
from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and 
cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global 
reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help 
nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will 
hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the 
allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and 
countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop 
new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every 
turn.

The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism 
and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking 
weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing 
so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to 
succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other 
means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, 
contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous 
technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America 
will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We 
cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must 
be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence 
and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who 
saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have 
entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.

As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic 
opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community 
has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 
seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace 
instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers 
find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist 
violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common 
interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by 
common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching 
for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese 
leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of 
national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political 
freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage 
the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, 
because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and 
international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great 
powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, 
trade, and cultural advancement.

Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend 
the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring 
the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to 
every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us 
that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our 
national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people 
into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and 
corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and 
drug cartels within their borders.

The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a 
better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free 
trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies 
out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual 
nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to 
build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. 
The United States will deliver greater development assistance through 
the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, 
invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also 
continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of 
AIDS and other infectious diseases.

In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is 
guided by the conviction that all nations have important 
responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. 
Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international 
aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For 
freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.

We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, 
better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply 
the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed 
to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade 
Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as 
other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment 
these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations 
are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to 
rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.

Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of 
every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has 
been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the 
clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and 
it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity 
holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all 
these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in 
this great mission.

I. Overview of America's International Strategy


""Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We 
fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors 
liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists 
and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among 
the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and 
open societies on every continent.""






President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength 
and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of 
liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with 
unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great 
strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that 
favors freedom.

For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great 
struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and 
equality.

That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and 
race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and 
discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we 
are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by 
catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must 
defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.

This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to 
translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, 
and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a 
distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our 
values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help 
make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to 
progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations 
with other states, and respect for human dignity.

And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.

To achieve these goals, the United States will:

*	champion aspirations for human dignity;

*	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent 
attacks against us and our friends;

*	work with others to defuse regional conflicts;

*	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our 
friends, with weapons of mass destruction;

*	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and 
free trade;

*	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building 
the infrastructure of democracy;

*	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of 
global power; and

*	transform America's national security institutions to meet the 
challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.


II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity


""Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 
language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require 
different methods, but not different moralities.""





President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we 
stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because 
these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation 
owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and 
mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live 
free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be 
oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of 
the secret police.

America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human 
dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; 
free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; 
religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.

These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served 
us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, 
facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these 
core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not 
been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and 
aspirations of their people.

Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in 
our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of 
Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a 
stronger, but is a freer and more just society.

Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And 
when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central 
and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When 
we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in 
the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin 
America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can 
evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all 
cherish.

Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, 
the national security strategy of the United States must start from 
these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.

Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international 
cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation 
of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international 
bodies.

We will:

*	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of 
human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to 
advance freedom;

*	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who 
struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward 
democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;

*	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key 
themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation 
from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights 
to move toward a better future; and

*	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience 
and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.


We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist 
it.

III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent 
Attacks Against Us and Our Friends


""Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have 
the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already 
clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been 
waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is 
peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on 
the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of 
our choosing.""





President Bush
Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)
September 14, 2001



The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of 
global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or 
religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, 
politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.

In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a 
lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed 
within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United 
States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals 
with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who 
knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.

The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in 
our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly 
elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come 
through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some 
unseen.

Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, 
and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to 
achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition 
forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not 
only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of 
trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South 
America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.

Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist 
organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, 
control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will 
have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.

We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a 
coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional 
campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure 
the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial 
tools necessary to finish the task.

The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the 
financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of 
funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who 
support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial 
system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, 
and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative 
financial networks.

However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the 
cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we 
seek.

We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:

*	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and 
international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist 
organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of 
terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD) or their precursors;

*	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests 
at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it 
reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to 
enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate 
to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by 
acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing 
harm against our people and our country; and

*	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists 
by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign 
responsibilities.


We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international 
terrorism. This includes:

*	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely 
with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are 
illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as 
slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government 
can condone or support and all must oppose;

*	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim 
world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote 
terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;

*	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by 
enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources 
on areas most at risk; and

*	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of 
information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of 
those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.


While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also 
strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter 
attack.

This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization 
since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council 
and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland 
Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental 
reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland 
encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public 
and the private sector.

This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, 
emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with 
terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened 
to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and 
mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop 
terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.

While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism 
in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. 
Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations 
and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where 
governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we 
will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and 
our allies can provide.

As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work 
with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as 
non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the 
humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to 
rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, 
threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists

In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are 
ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom 
and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this 
conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, 
productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in 
ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.

IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts


""We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. 
The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements 
look so small.""





President Bush
Berlin, Germany
May 23, 2002



Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional 
disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In 
an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our 
alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create 
horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states 
falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to 
alleviate suffering and restore stability.

No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- 
direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, 
and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States 
will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:

*	The United States should invest time and resources into building 
international relationships and institutions that can help manage local 
crises when they emerge.

*	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help 
those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when 
people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.


Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will 
apply these principles:

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of 
human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state 
of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance 
to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace 
for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed 
to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in 
peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a 
government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and 
counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all 
parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 
comprehensive settlement to the conflict.

The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank 
stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic 
development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to 
establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If 
Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront 
corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support 
for the creation of a Palestinian state.

Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. 
Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the 
United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete 
steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. 
As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw 
fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent 
with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement 
activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, 
freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians 
to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial 
role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and 
Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.

In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India 
and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested 
time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and 
Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a 
constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With 
Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's 
choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more 
open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to 
become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century 
and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our 
involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in 
bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan 
that can help defuse military confrontation.

Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and 
respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting 
the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to 
employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its 
neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by 
Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.

In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with 
countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic 
hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, 
opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as 
the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States 
(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of 
the entire hemisphere.

Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising 
from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict 
and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and 
security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active 
strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce 
their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of 
drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs 
in our own country.

In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist 
groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking 
activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are 
working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat 
illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective 
sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic 
security to the Colombian people.

In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, 
and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United 
States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- 
combating global terror. American interests and American principles, 
therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an 
African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. 
Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's 
fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous 
borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence 
infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.

An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars 
spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions 
of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to 
confronting these emerging transnational threats.

Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that 
focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This 
administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the 
region:

*	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South 
Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement 
and require focused attention;

*	coordination with European allies and international institutions is 
essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace 
operations; and

*	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations 
must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational 
threats on a sustained basis.


Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the 
surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are 
conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically 
waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to 
the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a 
common responsibility for democratic political systems offers 
opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.

V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends 
with Weapons of Mass Destruction


""The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and 
technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear 
weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, 
even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to 
strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and 
have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the 
capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and 
we will oppose them with all our power.""





President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our 
allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of 
force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security 
environment has undergone profound transformation.

Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our 
relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the 
balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear 
arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as 
counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were 
inconceivable.

But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. 
None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power 
that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and 
motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain 
destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest 
states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass 
destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex 
and dangerous.

In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue 
states that, while different in important ways, share a number of 
attributes. These states:

*	brutalize their own people and squander their national resources 
for the personal gain of the rulers;

*	display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, 
and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;

*	are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with 
other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively 
to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;

*	sponsor terrorism around the globe; and

*	reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything 
for which it stands.


At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's 
designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against 
Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear 
weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become 
the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested 
increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. 
Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as 
well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has 
become a looming threat to all nations.

We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients 
before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction 
against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must 
take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new 
partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military 
forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective 
missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence 
collection and analysis.

Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:

*	Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend 
against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key 
capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce 
capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our 
homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated 
into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of 
our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed 
adversaries.

*	Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and 
terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise 
necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, 
arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction 
assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when 
necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will 
continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their 
increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and 
threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 
billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step 
forward.

*	Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD 
use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of 
WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such 
weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading 
enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States 
must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our 
forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.


It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of 
this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the 
United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have 
in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy 
of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be 
caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. 
We cannot let our enemies strike first.

*	In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we 
faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an 
effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of 
retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states 
more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and 
the wealth of their nations.

*	In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered 
weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who 
used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons 
of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and 
military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also 
allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our 
allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior 
of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means 
of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.

*	Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a 
terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the 
targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death 
and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between 
states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to 
action.


For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer 
an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves 
against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars 
and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption 
on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible 
mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.

We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and 
objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not 
seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would 
fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use 
of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed 
and delivered covertly and without warning.

The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian 
population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law 
of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, 
mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and 
these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired 
and used weapons of mass destruction.

The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions 
to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the 
threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling 
the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if 
uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To 
forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United 
States will, if necessary, act preemptively.

The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging 
threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. 
Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek 
the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot 
remain idle while dangers gather.

We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our 
actions. To support preemptive options, we will:

*	build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide 
timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;

*	coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the 
most dangerous threats; and

*	continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to 
conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.


The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat 
to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our 
actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.

VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and 
Free Trade.


""When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a 
privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever 
enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in 
better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade 
revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.""





President Bush
Monterrey, Mexico
March 22, 2002



A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing 
prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth 
supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher 
incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs 
economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it 
reinforces the habits of liberty.

We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's 
shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic 
policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our 
economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of 
policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic 
growth, including:

*	pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business 
investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;

*	tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that 
improve incentives for work and investment;

*	rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are 
confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic 
endeavors;

*	strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most 
efficient use;

*	sound fiscal policies to support business activity;

*	investments in health and education that improve the well-being and 
skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and

*	free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the 
diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and 
opportunity.


The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not 
command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the 
best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further 
strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for 
all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the 
developing world.

A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. 
national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies 
for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake 
of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in 
their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are 
Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of 
non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to 
use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- 
including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they 
are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher 
global economic growth.

Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic 
growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand 
the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging 
markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise 
living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a 
world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that 
allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in 
their future.

We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve 
access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will 
continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial 
markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action 
Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and 
more effectively resolving them when they occur.

The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from 
occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing 
so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy 
conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on 
achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, 
exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.

The concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it 
became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others 
value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something 
that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the 
freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free 
trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:

*	Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we 
helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, 
especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for 
completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the 
accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade 
Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.

*	Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies 
in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United 
States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, 
targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and 
government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the 
poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences 
allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free 
trade.

*	Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the 
free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration 
will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and 
Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of 
developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. 
Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will 
be our principal focal points.

*	Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every 
administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with 
Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished 
majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing 
Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for 
developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will 
work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade 
agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade 
Promotion Authority.

*	Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade 
policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, 
competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open 
societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional 
integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in 
developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods 
produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more 
use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue 
to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer 
countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, 
the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public 
health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are 
flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical 
medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
malaria.

*	Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. 
Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on 
enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing 
disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a 
global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations 
that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws 
against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international 
community must be able to address genuine concerns about government 
subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which 
undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.

*	Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound 
statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used 
in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the 
American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the 
enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that 
the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American 
workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the 
change and dynamism of open markets.

*	Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster 
economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with 
widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental 
concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network"" 
between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the 
International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade 
talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.

*	Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security 
and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our 
allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and 
types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, 
Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to 
work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient 
technologies.


Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize 
greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing 
them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the 
global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse 
gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such 
emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 
years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be 
to:

*	remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for 
international cooperation;

*	obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of 
the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to 
companies that can show real cuts;

*	develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission 
reductions;

*	promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as 
well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, 
while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;

*	increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to 
a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change 
by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's 
budget; and

*	assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas 
emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and 
resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and 
better path.


VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building 
the Infrastructure of Democracy


""In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to 
rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we 
must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""





President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Inter-American
Development Bank)
March 14, 2002



A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human 
race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including 
all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and 
opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of 
U.S. international policy.

Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic 
growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served 
to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and 
perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars 
spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction 
achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.

Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this 
failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing 
for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and 
the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.

This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential 
of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is 
impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have 
implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels 
of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should 
set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's 
poorest economies within a decade.

The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to 
achieve this goal:

*	Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of 
national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core 
development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our 
present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, 
these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge 
Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest 
in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight 
corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest 
in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and 
enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward 
countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those 
that have not to implement reforms.

*	Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development 
banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a 
comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other 
multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of 
the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. 
contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. 
contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the 
World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African 
Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing 
poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially 
in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral 
development banks to focus on activities that increase economic 
productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, 
and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant 
must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in 
developing countries.

*	Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development 
assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's 
poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that 
more children are getting a better education, more people have access to 
health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a 
better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure 
the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering 
results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own 
development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral 
development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for 
achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation 
system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, 
donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the 
achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. 
contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the 
World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this 
progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything 
that these institutions do.

*	Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in 
the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants 
is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, 
particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with 
ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the 
poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, 
sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress 
by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development 
banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private 
sector to match government efforts by using grants to support 
development projects that show results.

*	Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are 
the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, 
most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and 
foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows 
as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national 
security strategy.

*	Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor 
countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics 
like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be 
threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the 
developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest 
governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective 
local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new 
global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for 
treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than 
twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the 
global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.

*	Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of 
democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources 
are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States 
will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 
percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher 
training in Africa. The United States can also bring information 
technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been 
devastated by AIDS.

*	Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, 
including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields 
in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. 
Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits 
to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still 
suffer from hunger and malnutrition.


VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers 
of Global Power


""We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th 
century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead 
of prepare for war.""





President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as 
broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance 
of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires 
clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent 
consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.

There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can 
accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies 
and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the 
strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its 
inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European 
security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world 
trade.

The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself 
recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the 
first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the 
transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop 
new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new 
circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, 
highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to 
respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.

The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, 
creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to 
mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:

*	expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and 
able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;

*	ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate 
combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;

*	develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become 
effective multinational fighting forces;

*	take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of 
scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that 
they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;

*	streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to 
meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of 
training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; 
and

*	maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as 
we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.


If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a 
partnership as central to the security and interests of its member 
states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common 
perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to 
take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the 
same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater 
foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to 
close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We 
cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of 
transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.

The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. 
Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an 
attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the 
dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation 
Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented 
levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist 
attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our 
alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received 
invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.

The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia 
not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and 
ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and 
friendships, we will:


*	look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and 
global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our 
close defense and diplomatic cooperation;

*	work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while 
preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of 
the region over the longer-term;

*	build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we 
continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as 
we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;

*	maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our 
allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic 
environment; and

*	build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with 
institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage 
change in this dynamic region.


We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power 
competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of 
internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all 
three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly 
global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.

With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based 
on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and 
Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on 
Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a 
critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, 
long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United 
States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their 
country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- 
needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that 
Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that 
Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.

United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to 
refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and 
challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the 
global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the 
World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to 
promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have 
created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security 
cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will 
continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the 
former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable 
neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration 
into the Euro-Atlantic community.

At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still 
divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to 
build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our 
motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our 
relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market 
democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very 
weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those 
opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even 
decades.

The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral 
relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests 
require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest 
democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative 
government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We 
have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through 
the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest 
in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.

Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear 
and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But 
while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about 
India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with 
which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership 
with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic 
future.

The United States relationship with China is an important part of our 
strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific 
region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous 
China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. 
Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst 
features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the 
next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. 
In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its 
neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated 
path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national 
greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is 
the only source of that greatness.

The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing 
China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including 
the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean 
peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan 
and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and 
similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, 
such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the 
welfare of our citizens.

Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become 
more open with information, promote the development of civil society, 
and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to 
political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting 
village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national 
one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly 
accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work 
remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, 
assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.

Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into 
the World Trade Organization, which will create more export 
opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, 
and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over 
$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and 
the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance 
openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic 
protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other 
areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the 
self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human 
rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation 
commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but 
not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.

The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for 
relations between the United States and other main centers of global 
power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies 
in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we 
must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships 
become routine and unproductive.

Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We 
can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober 
analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices 
that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open 
the path of progress.

IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the 
Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century


""Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch 
its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, 
and enterprise of our people.""





President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)
September 20, 2001



The major institutions of American national security were designed in a 
different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be 
transformed.

It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. 
We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's 
highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, 
our military must:

*	assure our allies and friends;

*	dissuade future military competition;

*	deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and

*	decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.


The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their 
forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most 
strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must 
confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to 
deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on 
how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might 
occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational 
challenges.

The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound 
symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our 
willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, 
the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of 
power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the 
many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases 
and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as 
well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment 
of U.S. forces.

Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major 
planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate 
across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch 
of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by 
developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision 
strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. 
This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the 
ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure 
U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. 
infrastructure and assets in outer space.

Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new 
approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. 
intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and 
technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is 
run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. 
Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight 
the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a 
wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of 
coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.

We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from 
experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must 
and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- 
whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United 
States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces 
sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces 
will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a 
military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the 
United States.

Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense 
against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed 
around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, 
fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping 
with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of 
targets.

We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to 
keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be 
appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems 
and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the 
capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the 
knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek 
the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and 
to maximize injury.

We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide 
integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since 
the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted 
inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of 
information between intelligence and law enforcement.

Initiatives in this area will include:

*	strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence 
to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence 
capabilities;

*	establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides 
seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing 
the nation and our allies;

*	continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to 
sustain our intelligence advantage;

*	investing in future capabilities while working to protect them 
through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence 
capabilities; and

*	collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the 
government with all-source analysis.


As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend 
America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other 
nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding 
sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State 
Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with 
other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must 
be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations 
and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in 
international politics must also extend their reach to understand 
complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public 
health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.

Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil 
wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief 
requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build 
police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial 
government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international 
cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American 
readiness to play our part.

Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out 
to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to 
public information efforts that can help people around the world learn 
about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of 
civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, 
a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas 
and this is an area where America must excel.

We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet 
our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired 
by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the 
International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend 
to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with 
other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and 
cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral 
agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will 
implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose 
provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. 
personnel and officials.

We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the 
right level and allocation of government spending on national security. 
The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this 
war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for 
the American people.

Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is 
diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have 
a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, 
and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- 
our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are 
vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we 
bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. 
As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that 
until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This 
is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite 
of it.

In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and 
interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act 
apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we 
disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for 
our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow 
such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with 
our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.

Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the 
skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of 
our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, 
entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that 
energy. That is where our national security begins.

  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
  By Peter Henderson 

  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.

  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
  making computers which manage networks. 
  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.

  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. 

  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
  needed. 
  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
  different vendors to interoperate closely. 
  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. 

  ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
  time for priority users, the company said.

  | I vote for this being added to CVS, any objections?

No, but using PickMarkSeen (and pick(ids)) as an alternative to
just doing

	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results

seems unnecessary to me (that's all that PickMarkSeen does after all).
(That can be done via ""busy"")

Of course, the same is true of the badly named Pick_MarkSeen which has
nothing at all to do with ""pick"" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var
in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it
is known in app-defaults files for the ""Catch Up Unseen"" menu item, but
its implementation could certainly be fixed).

By PAUL CROSBIE
Sep 16, 2002

VIRGIN'S latest airliner is being revamped after randy passengers
discovered a tiny cabin was just the place to join the Mile High Club.

The £130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and
baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies.

But couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk.

Virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only
came into service a few weeks ago.

It is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who
launched it in July.

Now Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table.

At first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were
baffled by the problem.

The table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby.

One Airbus worker said: ""We couldn't work it out. Then the penny
dropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It
caused great amusement.""

The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about £200.

A Virgin spokeswoman said: ""Those determined to join the Mile High
Club will do so despite the lack of comforts.

""We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something
that we would encourage because of air regulations.""

The new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan
""Mine is bigger than yours"". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far
East and the US.

better yet would be a built-in server check on a periodic basis, even
daily, looking for the existence of an update, and if found prompt the
system admin to upgrade the server.  With the ever changing face of spam,
this would probably be a big benefit to SA users and help keep everyone up
to date.  We have not done this with too many of the apps we sell on
www.RoseCitySoftware.com strictly because of joe-average-user concerns
about spyware and ""phoning home"", but in cases where the app needs to
access the internet anyhow, we have done it with great success and minimal
concern by our users.

Depends on how you want to use it.

The default setup of running it from procmail works just fine, as long as 
you remember to go into your postfix/main.cf file, and tell it to use 
procmail instead of the internal delivery agent.

I don't think gpg signing my repositories will help anything, as it will
just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md5 signatures of
all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me
who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the
process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up.

In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about ""No Key"" appear until you
import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example :
rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY
(this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages)

Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who
verify against an imported gpg key? This for me would be the optimal way to
ensure integrity with the way things curently work.

That's fixed now.  I thought I'd caught all the occurrences of that particular 
coding stupidity.

I propose they rename it ""Charlie Heston High"" and maybe the students  
will learn to take AR-15s with extended military-spec scopes and .223  
high-velocity ammo and start plinking innocent civilians at random in  
the suburbs of Washington.  That's far more effectual than blowing  
oneself up in a bus.

In America these days, it seems that violence ascribed to any political  
doctrine foreign to Bushism is vile and repugnant.  But random violence  
is entertainment and intrigue.

A couple of ex-FBI ""consultants"" speaking on the shootings in DC were  
quoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a  
""heroin-like high"" from each successful kill and that they ""for  
whatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose  
at law enforcement and society.""

See?  Just a couple of kids having fun with Daddy's semi-automatic  
hunting rifle.  Harmless!

I successfully installed spamassassin & razor to run system wide on my
Debian Woody server.  
 
Briefly I 
apt-get installed spamassassin razor and libmilter-dev,
 
downloaded spamass-milter-0.1.2.tar.gz from http://www.milter.org,
ungzipped and untarred the file into /etc/mail, 
 
followed the directions in /etc/mail/spamass-milter-0.1.2/README to
compile the milter, install the rc scripts, and edit and update
sendmail.mc
 
changed /etc/default/spamassassin to set spamassassin to daemon mode.
 
verified that spamassassin was running by tailing /var/log/mail.log
 
 
Woody/stable has SA 2.20
Woody/unstable has SA 2.41

I'm running the stable source live right now and it is working very
well.

If you want unstable change /etc/apt/sources.list, substituting
""unstable"" for ""stable"",
Run apt-get update
Install the unstable versions
Change /etc/apt/sources.list
Run apt-get update

I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.

Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).

Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.

So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

Why wait until you're dead? I'm sure there's enough carbon in
the fat from your typical liposuction job to make a decent diamond.

X-Spam-Level: 

This is my first time running Razor, heard a lot of good things about it so
I thought I'd give it a shot.  I also run SpamAssassin so I'd like to
integrate the two.

I'm not sure if this problem is with SpamAssassin or Razor, so I though I'd
shoot the message here first

With a freshly installed SpamAssassin 2.41 and Razor 2.14 I'm seeing these
messages spit out from spamd:

razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can't call method ""log"" on
unblessed reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm
line 211, <STDIN> line 75.

Any ideas?  razor seems to run correctly over the command line.

Thanks,
-Dave

Ok, I got ALSA installed and there is no static inbetween mp3s like
before which is great!  My setup is digital 4.1 but sound is only coming
from front 2 speakers and subwoofer, rear speakers there is no sound. 
Also alsamixer or aumix are unresponsive as well.

  | The background color in this window is the same as the background 
  | color in the ftoc.

That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
than others.

In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
it doesn't need a different background as well.

I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
horizontal, and see what turns up.

  | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
  | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.

OK.

  | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
  | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.

In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
""all unknown"" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)


  | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?

  | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.

Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
(for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
bit too similar.   I ended up using

*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
is probably safer for generic use.

 I seem to be having a little trouble with it. My printers.conf is:

<DefaultPrinter lp>
Info Hp4050
Location locals
DeviceURI ipp://192.168.2.90:9100/
State Idle
Accepting Yes
JobSheets none none
QuotaPeriod 0
PageLimit 0
KLimit 0
</Printer>

 and cupds uses that to make a printcap of:

lp:

 Sounds dodgy to me. If someone has an example printers.conf/printcap for
a JetDirect printer, I'd appreciate it if they sent it on.

Subject: [Spambayes] Deployment
Message-ID: <200209061431.g86EVM114413@pcp02138704pcs.reston01.va.comcast.net>

Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to
think about deployment.

Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a
spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions
about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it
as a filter.

A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can
easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find
individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).

There are many ways to do this.  Some ideas:

- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You
  configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then
  point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it
  receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads
  your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.  To train it, you'd only
  need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that
  anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.

- A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message
  and that answers ""spam"" or ""ham"".  Then you have a little program
  that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server.  (The
  server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the
  scoring database for each message.  I don't know how big that pickle
  would be, maybe loading it each time is fine.  Or maybe
  marshalling.)

- Your idea here.

Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The Perl
Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?

I would appreciate it if you could get Gabber packages for Red Hat 8. I 
will be making a new release soon, but even in the meantime, 0.8.7 
packages would be ok.

I know that in the beta, red hat was using a modified version of 
gnome-libs which is incompatible with the latest gnomemm. If this is 
still the case in 8, I can send you a patch which makes gnomemm work 
again...

No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether
Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from
various sources, considerable debate within that country. There's complex
issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty
environmentalists, which was my original point.

Uh, zero.  I'm sort of offended at having to take this question seriously,
like being black and having to actually explain that black people don't
all sing and dance.  I'd guess that gay men compared to straight men have
a linearly greater number of sexual partners on the order of 1.5-2X.  But
then again, it not a monolithic or homogeneous community.  Who knows?

3K is utter shite.

Well if you're talking about epiphany, which is in January, then yes it is
5 months.Some people do celebrate Christmas on january 6th, or even the 13th.

But I am certain that what you are thinking is the correct thought.

Please don't flame me. Just trying to be humerous =)

Hi,

some time now the following messages were haunting me:

     automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude

It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.

# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches
...

I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
himself is ""dude"", and some package has hardwired a path in his build
directory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too
many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.

Regards, Axel.

The USAF had a program in the 1959-1960 in which successful free jumps 
were made from balloons at up to ~32 km (100,000 ft.). The relevance was 
astronauts and SR-71 bailouts. This would top that achievement 
comfortably.

The President's niece will no longer have to forge prescriptions for Valium. 
All she'll have to do is participate in an unruly public demonstration to get a 
free dose. Unfortunately for her, the government has no plans to shoot rocks of 
cocaine at demonstrators, so she'll still have to depend on her drug dealer for 
that. 

    The U.S. military is exploring ways to use drugs such as Valium to calm 
    people without killing them during riots or other crowd control situations 
    where lethal weapons are inappropriate.

 Hello,
   
         I just installed redhat 7.2 and I think I have everything 
working properly.  Anyway I want to install mplayer because I heard it 
can play quicktime movs.  I apt-get source mplayer and dl'd it to 
/usr/src. 

         I tried to just rpm --rebuild mplayer-20020106-fr1.src.rpm, 
then I get ; mplayer-20020106-fr1.src.rpm: No such file or directory.

         Any help or a link to some document would be appreciated, Thanks
-rob

A good plan, needs an implementation though: 

        http://bl.reynolds.net.au/ksi/email/

hmm. seems down to me.  Basically it's a plan to store hash sums of
URLs/phone numbers found in spam in a DNSBL, for apps like SpamAssassin to
look up.  A little like spamcop's ""spamvertized URL"" list...

Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me.  I like it a lot of the 
time, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get 
on TV.  Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to 
get information.

but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as
well protected as any other political speech.  Spam is *the* tool for
dissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients
can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.

That explains...

Well, with 7.0, I've seen a few problems with doing that, but as of 7.2
it's really wonderful! Ever tried of completely uninstalling all openssh
related packages while being connected through ssh? Well, it works!!!! Of
course, if the connection cuts at that moment, you're stuck, but a simple
upgrade with official Red Hat packages also works like a charm :-)

Huh?  Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard?
Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If
shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time
before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and
non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic
is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.
And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not
really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.

Hey,
I has just been given an old Toshiba CS100 with earliest pentium and 400mb
of HD but only a floppy drive on it, its got Win3.1 which is funny to see
again but gonna be cleared as soon as i stop messing with it. What I was
wondering was could anyone advise what O/S would be good for this, I want a
small usable *nix distro for it that i can transfer to it fom floppy.
Connecting this to Winblows>i know that winblows allows pier-to-pier
connections over serial and parellel ports to other winblows but is this
easy do for connecting winblows to *nix???

SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- The U.S.
Justice Department filed an appeal Monday to
overturn a federal judge's ruling that
upheld Oregon's doctor-assisted suicide law.

A spokesman for Oregon Attorney General
Hardy Myers said the state views the appeal
as ""same story, different day.""

Oregon voters approved doctor-assisted
suicide twice, in ballot initiatives in 1994
and 1997. But in November, U.S. Attorney
General John Ashcroft warned Oregon doctors
they would be prosecuted under federal law
if they prescribed lethal doses of drugs for
dying patients.

In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in
particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.

My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

Can't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management

If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.

You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.

Buzzword.

Unsupported assertion.

Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.

Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.

Yes.

It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes
me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!
Not.

Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.


>Why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems

Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.


I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for
courses.

For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury the
Greens.  A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they
would have had to invent it.  So it is with global warming.  Their
fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial
civilization.

The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming
theorists said should be there is old news.  The news here is that the
temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have
been validated with a different means of measurement.

Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global
warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the
""Medieval Warm Period"".  Said period was warmer than what we have now,
and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.

In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused
DIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn't trap that much heat.  Water vapor does,
and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have
your warming theory.

Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over
long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback
loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.

More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more
clouds.  Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great
deal on how the cloud formation shakes out.  Most climate models admit
they do clouds very poorly.

I had cited the information theoretic concept of ""elegance""
in my dissertation & did a Google to find the reference and instead
found a really great tech report for UoT Knoxville by Bruce
MacLennan.  He cites Efficiency, Economy, and Elegance, but
I think he's wrong.  The middle E should be Effectiveness. 
Otherwise kudos.


Efficiency is the relation of output to input effectiveness is
the total output.  In information theory, something is both elegant
and efficient if no smaller or less costly something can product the 
same output in the same amount of time.

The Value of Analogies

Programming language design is a comparatively new activity - it has existed for less than half a century, so
it is
often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity. Thus, my book
Principles of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching
methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.
Perhaps you
have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune
buggy, etc.). 

These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but
they
cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must
be
based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. 

In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks
on a
book about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many
differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer
rather
directly. 

According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call
``the
three E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,
which
Billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in
turn. 


Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used

In structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety
and the
issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language
design,
efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where
efficiency
considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming
Languages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing
time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was
programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's
implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed
for the
sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). 

Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we
are
not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as
programmer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are
reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now
turn. 


Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost

Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks
to
maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges
are
usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public''
that
must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these
programmers work. 

Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,
the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost
of
computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the
increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of
program
maintenance compared to program development. 

Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major
manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some
way
by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether
it
comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by
novices
or dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are
frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming
language. 

Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are
often
unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from
dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately
represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered
in
seeking an economical design. 


Elegance Symbolizes Good Design

``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the
critical
role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering. 

For the Designer

It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the
difficulty
of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).
Structural
engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don't
make
extensive use of computer models and calculation. 

One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which
variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this
decision is not
made well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this
is
another potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical
analysis
may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of
safety is
additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). 

Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a
choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an
over-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. 

Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it
vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.
Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a
consequence of
an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed
the
Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided
by aesthetic principles. 

According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do
not
abandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because
solutions to
structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible
solutions to a
particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention
to
designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are
unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. 

The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can
be
guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea
by
inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds
(p.
21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice of
form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and
economical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. 

The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the
interaction
of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our
aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having
to
check all the possible interactions. 

For the User

In this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge
that
looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which
features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed
bridge
gives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should
reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the
consequences
of our actions. 

We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to
sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the
outside.
So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation
of a
deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their
(unwarranted)
confidence. 

In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a
consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or
programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited
value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the
preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages: 
                                The Elegance Principle

              Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. 



The Programming Language as Work Environment

There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming
language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable
and
safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that
take
place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? 

A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's
fatigue
and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,
encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a
natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging
the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming
language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. 

Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of
its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may
represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming
language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by
neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.
Out of
sight, out of mind. 


Acquiring a Sense of Elegance

Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined
sense
of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive
experience
in design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.
Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each
competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public
also
critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along
with that of the designers. 

So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -
and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs
and try
to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing''
comes
along.

Blake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to 
admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you 
really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!""

Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of 
course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in 
mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily 
agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas 
regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is 
an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.

To cover the list specifically:


- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's 
proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is 
painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in 
order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.

- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the 
useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain 
speed.

- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield 
widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, 
slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's 
top usability problem.

- Message display - Yes. No argument here.

- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's 
a mess.

- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be 
separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with 
multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., 
you can eliminate the New submenu easily).

- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.

- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS 
default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. 
If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla 
usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. 
(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 
wants to fire it.)

- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is 
completely irrelevant.

- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a 
tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique 
dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly 
half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously 
overconfigurable.

What does this mean?  I set up procmailrc for a spamtrap but I'm getting
an error.  I also am reporting to pyzor and dcc and they aren't
registering an error.  What's weird is that it works sometimes.

Oh well.  Fair enough.

Ugh, way too much manual labor.  :-)

What I've done instead is to create a tiny little ""kernel.spec"" that
installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version
number `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims to
provide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make
alsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation
of what my homemade kernel provides to the system.  I should have
thought of this approach sooner.

A bit more detail.  I get destined for many addresses: skip@pobox.com,
skip@calendar.com, concerts@musi-cal.com, webmaster@mojam.com, etc.  I
originally wrote (a slightly different version of) the loosecksum.py script
I'm about to check in to avoid manually scanning all those presumed spams
which are really identical.  Once a message was identified as spam, what I
refer to as a loose checksum was computed to try and avoid saving the same
spam multiple times for later review.

I'll check it in.  Let me know if you find it useful.

It also depends on what the fad is or what is in style.  (:

Actualy our silly antiquated ideas about relationships and love have 
resulted in the bleedings of many upon many a page (and musical  instrumnet, 
and canvas)  What's the problem if we dash a little Mrs. Dash on them?  (:  
Or cayenne.  Or ginger. (mm ask me about ginger root play).  

And let me tell you this: just because a child happens to be 
single-parented (what a word), does not mean that child is dysfunctional 
or lives in a dysfunctional home.  The govt/media/church has tried to make 
it look like there is a disintegration, when in fact, there is a coming 
together of other family members and friends to raise children.  It's not 
decaying -- it's changing.  Nothing wrong with change.

Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
there, so no passphrase can be entered.  Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
proper focus set.

I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.

tokenize() couldn't be easier to use:  it takes a string argument, and
produces a stream of tokens (whether via explicit list, or generator, or
tuple, or ... doesn't matter).  All the tokenize() functions in GBayes.py
and timtest.py are freely interchangeable this way.

Note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would
do any good, or, if it would, in which ways customization could be helpful.
That's a research issue on which no work has been done.

That's partly a failure of imagination <wink>.  Splitting out all knowledge
of tokenization is just a large block cut-and-paste ... there, it's done.
Change the

    from timtoken import tokenize

at the top to use any other tokenizer now.  If you want to make it easier
still, feel free to check in something better.

The Msg and MsgStream classes in timtest.py are a start at that, but it's
hard to do anything truly *useful* here when people use all sorts of
different physical representations for email msgs (mboxes in various
formats, one file per ""folder"", one file per msg, Skip's gzipped gimmick,
...).  If you're a Python coder <wink>, you *should* find it very easy to
change the guts of Msg and MsgStream to handle your peculiar scheme.
Defining interfaces for these guys should be done.

This sounds like a bottomless pit to me, and there's no easier way to
customize than to edit the code.  As README.txt still says, though, massive
refactoring would help.  Hop to it!

With project budgets in the multiple millions of dollars and virtually no 
margin for error, more and more development teams are under tremendous pressure 
to come out on top of the entertainment software market's cutthroat 
competition. No team manager wants to contemplate dropping the ball when 
creating the vivid graphics necessary to help make a game a success. Electronic 
Arts' The Sims franchise is an excellent example of this pressurized situation. 
This article highlights the critical issues that govern the high volume asset 
production needed for today's most demanding games.

Ken Dow reports[1] that the current version of OmniOutliner can read and write 
OPML. This means, for example, with a little Radio script (or an AppleScript) 
you could use Omni as an Instant Outliner[2].

As Dan said -- it's a hard corpus, made harder without the spamtrap data.

Also -- and this is an important point -- those measurements can't be
directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.

In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.

Hi,

Thank you for the useful replies, I have found some interesting 
tutorials in the ibm developer connection.

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec1

and

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec2

Registration is needed.

I will post the same message on the Web Application Security list, as 
suggested by someone.

For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the 
approach described in secure programmin fo linux and unix how-to).

I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its 
implementation at anytime.

Thank you again!

Mario Torre

I installed Spamassassin 2.41 with Razor V2 the other day and it has =
been working great. I decided to add Pyzor last night and I got that =
installed successfully (I think, no errors). I am using spamd and I see =
where it periodically spawns off a pyzor process; however nothing has =
been detected as spam by Pyzor under Spamassassin. It has been running =
for almost half a day now on a 5,000 user mail server - so to me the =
odds of something being caught by it should be high. I run spamd as =
follows:

spamd -d -H

and all my users home directories have a .pyzor directory with the =
server listed under it.

I setup a test procmail recipe that just invokes pyzor check and not =
spamc to see if in fact pyzor alone catches any spam -  I just set this =
up so no results yet. Here is what I get when I check connectivity to =
the pyzor server:

 pyzor -d ping
sending: 'User: anonymous\nTime: 1031921041\nSig: =

Any help/examples would be appreciated. Thanks! BTW, keep up the great =
work Spamassassin team!

The WSJ has published a round-up of phone companies, wired and wireless, 
ranking them based on performance and price. They don't mention Nextel, whose 
hullking milspec i700 handset I've been carrying for years now, with incredible 
reception all over the US and Canada. Their front-line customer service sucks, 
but the prices and network can't be beat. 

    T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the 
    company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta 
    Jones. 

    The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche 
    Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received 
    1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the 
    worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate 
    has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements. 

    But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average 
    cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents 
    per minute.)

Japanese toilet technology has developed creeping featuritis. New Tokyo toities 
sport speech-recognition, air-conditioning, and body-chemistry monitors: 

    Japan's toilet wars started in February, when Matsushita engineers here 
    unveiled a toilet seat equipped with electrodes that send a mild electric 
    charge through the user's buttocks, yielding a digital measurement of 
    body-fat ratio. 

    Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April 
    with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared 
    sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six 
    soundtracks, including chirping birds, rushing water, tinkling wind chimes, 
    or the strumming of a traditional Japanese harp.

I think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham.  I
like the general approach that copies of random messages will be
sequestered for some period of time before they're assumed to be ham.
Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the
training up to date with little effort.  I've sketched out an approach
a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some
free time I'll hack something together.

I like the idea of a POP proxy which is classifying messages as
they're pulled from the server.  The easiest way for such a beast to
be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
folder or file that the POP proxy would periodically consult.

It's not a *trick*!  It just requires this

  package_dir = {'spambayes': '.'}

in the setup script.

harrumph!  ""trick"" indeed...

Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.

The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.

Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.

Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.

""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""

N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.

While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.

Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.

I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, it looks 
like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.

If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the 
Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  
Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As 
long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is 
directing people to, I'm home free.

Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't ""lose"" any email, what do I gain 
by making it easier for spam to get through??

My corpus is about 50% spamtrap spam at any given time. Let me know if I
should leave that out next time, I do keep it separate. My spamtraps are
pretty clean of viruses and bounce messages most of the time.

Not so odd, this issue came up several weeks ago (with no real
resolution).

Everything else :)  I can't even mark text in an exmh message window
and then paste it into a terminal window, the cut buffer seems to be
completely empty (and its previous contents are no longer there
either).

  BTW: talking of spring downunder... I'm in Queensland.  It almost
  feels like early summer already (winters here are dry and warm,
  much better than cold wet miserable Melbourne :-)  Despite some
  recent rain (first in months), we are already into a drought, with
  an El-Nino on the way it is only going to get worse...  (the last
  one in the 90s caused one of the worst droughts ever seen here in
  aussie).

apt-get'able soundtracker there :-)

Anyone know where to get a good selection of samples/loops?

A nice curse. Don't get ""shroyre"", though.

While I was playing with the past issues, it annoyed me that there was
no easy way to make the log stop growing (I don't mean to truncate it,
I mean to just freeze it for a while).

The following patch adds a new button to the log window, which allows
the log to be switched on/off (the button says ""Disable"" when the
log is enabled, and the button disables it, and ""Enable"" when the log
is frozen, and the button enables it again).

Test your knowledge with this set of movie quotes. I'll be back in a couple of 
days with the answers.


-  Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away? 

-  Any fool can get into college. Only a select few can say the same about 
Amanda Jones.

-  My dear, since Eve picked the apple, no woman has ever been taken entirely 
unawares.

-  This is Tommy. He tells people he's named after a gun, but I know he's named 
after a famous 19th century ballerina.

-  When one woman strikes at the heart of another she seldom misses, and the 
wound is invariably fatal.

-  I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my 
dress off, it's _most_ unusual.

-  You're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend. I don't 
want to know you or what you do. I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't 
want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in 
advance, so I won't be there.

-  Kids: 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.

-  Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.

-  A hundred million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet 
smaller than my sister.

-  Mother, I do not need a blind date. Particularly not with some verbally 
incontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses 
like her mother.

-  Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?
She happens to be my daughter.
Oh. Then I guess you have.

-  I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.

-  Of course, you won't be able to lie on your back for a while but then you 
can lie from any position, can't you?

-  The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that 
it was going to happen.

-  Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place.

-  You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are 
the same decaying organic matter as everything else.

-  Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue! 

-  The issue is not whether you are paranoid. Look around you Lenny. The issue 
is whether you are paranoid enough.

-  Inconceivable!
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. 

Enjoy.

Back when 64KB was more memory than any computer would ever need, there was a 
time when memory managers didnt exist. But gradually, new computer systems 
came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up 
RAM faster than any system could dish it out. This discussion is based on 
Tiburon's experiences in writing and rewriting the memory manager for Madden 
NFL 97 to Madden NFL 2002.

But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g.
Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this
combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are
fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you
still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of
static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be
alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best
which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard
drives become cheaper.

Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term
significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static
application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large
client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because
these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different
sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also
tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular
with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence
services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a
physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application
server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I
use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable
because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap
space. Who knows what Windows does internally?)

My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID
device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image
partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but
solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of
base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the
server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then
market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that
rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer
overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized
modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this
particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend
application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself
has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could
help.

I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a
hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no
knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a
product, I'd love to hear about it.

Hi,

Red Hat 8.0 is released tomorrow (monday).  I took some time out to make 
RPMs of GStreamer for it.

All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt 
repository in a new ""redhat-80-i386"" directory.

The repository for dependencies is again called ""deps"", and the one for 
the gstreamer rpms is ""redhat"", because this time around the base distro 
contains all the necessary packages.

A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at
http://thomas.apestaart.org/download/screenshots/redhat-80-gst-player.png


Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms :

a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't 
have a -devel package for it yet

b) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve.
Here are the errors:

INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin 
/usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load: Error loading plugin 
/usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so, reason: /usr/lib/libaviplay-0.7.so.0: 
undefined symbol: _ZTVN10__cxxabiv120__si_class_type_infoE

Plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load
DEBUG(15299: 0)gst_plugin_load_plugin:161: attempt to load plugin 
""/usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so""

/usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so, reason: /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so: 
undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0

I'm not sure how to fix this; running strings on the libs in /usr/lib 
reveals that there are other libs that have these symbols, so there must 
be something straightforward that should fix this.
If anyone has a suggestion, please share ;)

Thomas

Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to
just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!

This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!

However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only
the items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing
the listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:
1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the
   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is
   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would
   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.
   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics
   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,
   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and
    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)

1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'
    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll
    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.

1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)
    in BIOS, please.

2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan
   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off
   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good
  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an
  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)
     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs
  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display
  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion
  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)
      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative
  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle
  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally
  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them
  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides
  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little
  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep
  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 

3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the
    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to
    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but
    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified
   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the
   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with
   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides
   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted
   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.
     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,
   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see
   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great
   candidates) base.  
      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight
    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-
    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare
    hood) to feed
    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent 
    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.
      The logo should be a coloration of a
   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew
   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/
   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and
   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the
   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the
   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.
   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.

4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.

Other details:
USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.
Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port
should round out the offering.  An option for just-released 
.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more
reviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,
and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.
CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card
interfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to
USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.
To that end, a backup solution with compression using
USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice 
bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....


Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): 
Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.
Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,
builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and 
frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map
and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that
says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. 
Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps 
an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as 
keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.
2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 
18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our
(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.
Actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation 
fan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade
Runner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling
and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user
seat and provide mineral water.
HyperTransport ports.

Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q172668: Barney Fun on Imagination Island 
Error Message: Barney Not Found[1]. Microsoft ActiMates Interactive Barney may 
conflict with a wide range of radio-operated electronic devices, including 
burglar alarms, resulting in the dreaded &#8220;Barney Not Found&#8221; error. 
To resolve this problem, Microsoft recommends turning off your burglar alarm. 

Incidentally, this is the funniest MS KBase article I've seen since Earth 
Rotates in Wrong Direction[2].

Here's a weird and wacky problem:

I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.

This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.

Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?

Cheers,
Waider.

O utensils of the world --

I wonder if it is possible to reverse-engineer the Reed-Solomon 
error-correcting codes to create a bytestream such that, when burned 
onto a CD, you can make out a picture in the diffraction pattern?

I suppose this is a modern equivalent to line-printer artwork; I was 
imagining using a CD-RW drive to use the outer track, say, to spell out 
the disc title, creation time, etc. It would sure beat feeding CDs 
through a laser printer :-)

Not at 40,000 m. I found this article 
(http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,53928,00.html) :

""The last person to try to break the highest free fall record died in 
the attempt. In 1965, New Jersey truck driver Nick Piantanida suffered 
catastrophic equipment failure when his facemask blew out at 57,000 
feet. Lack of oxygen caused such severe brain damage that he went into a 
coma and died four months later.""

And in amongst the flash at
http://www.legrandsaut.org/site_en/

you can discover that he will break the sound barrier at 35,000 m,
presumably reaching top speed somewhere above 30,000.

What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.  There's
promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the
industry:

 o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,
   a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.
 o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
   about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
   just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
   when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
   time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
 o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.
   I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
   listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
   to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
   row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
   about two dozen third world countries. 
 o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
   about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
   you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
 o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
   enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
   automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
   go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
   of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.
 o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  
 o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due
   to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that
   is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their
   forms submission.

What's wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wasting
your time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I'm sure there's
someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA""
""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which
freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them
to waste even more time playing Web form geography.  

I'm starting to see the light of Passport.  You want more information?  Hit
this passport button.  Voila.  IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff,
but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field
that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that 
automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the 
average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  

So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for
business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission
and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as
working all that well.

Back when 64KB was more memory than any computer would ever need, there was a 
time when memory managers didnt exist. But gradually, new computer systems 
came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up 
RAM faster than any system could dish it out. This discussion is based on 
Tiburon's experiences in writing and rewriting the memory manager for Madden 
NFL 97 to Madden NFL 2002.

Well, here's my semi-coherent rant for the moment.  ;)

I have >3100 spamtraps on my machine (you can multiply that by each domain
if you really want to).  The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never
ever existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to
deliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering
to 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting ""User unknown"" until I
got around to making them spamtraps.

So my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :)
If your ""business"" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,
it's in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can
say ""10 million email addresses"" and not technically be lying, even if
the majority of them don't work.

If you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, but
then again you don't really care: you probably want to relay through
someone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to every
email address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce address
because again it's easy to trace you.

So I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think
you're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of
opting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don't
relay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.

Everyone else doesn't really care.


That's my view anyway. :)

 Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 
 ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.
 
 ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""
 
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 
 ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks.""
 
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 
 ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""
 
 One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".
 
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself"".
 
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 
 ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens.""
 
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

This sort of thing is, in my (limited?) experience, increasingly a thing 
of the past. Not one person I know has found it worth the risk to pursue 
a relationship with someone in the workplace. It's terrible to think we 
could litigate our way into extinction...!

The right to speak is not the same as the right to be heard by the audience
of the speakers choice.

Disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness - but that's a
pretty lame way to do it. If it truly is the only way, then I'm all for it,
but disruption for the sake of showing how committed the protesters are is
pretty weak.

X-Spam-Level: 

Forgive me for being a partially stupid end-user of this fantastic
spam fighting software.

I was looking at my spamd debug output today, and noticed that it ran
through Razor2 stuff, and then it ran through dccproc, and then it tried to
go through old Razor1 stuff.  I'm assuming (and please correct me if I'm
wrong) that Razor1 is out dated and was to be replaced entirely by Razor2.

If that's the case, can someone please point me to something that explains
how to remove Razor1 from my system?  I don't see a point in envoking it.
Especially when it appears to error out on me.

debug: Razor1 is available
debug: entering helper-app run mode
debug: Razor Agents 1.19, protocol version 2.
debug: 170803 seconds before closest server discovery
debug: Agent terminated
Problem while trying to load Razor1: Permission denied  at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm line 288.
debug: leaving helper-app run mode

Thanks!

Can you submit this to bugzilla?  It definately is a bug, I mean I do
a packet trace and here's what I get with one of my spams:

[the request]

So spamd is definately returning false incorrectly.

I think another venue for finding people is the workplace. As a contractor
I have had the opertunity to meet lots of eligables over the course of my
wandering workhistory.

My wife was my Task Order Manager years ago, thats  how we met. Her joke
is that she is still my Task Order Manager but now I dont get paid:)-

By starting up your own companies or working in sterile thinklabs you are
cutting yourself off from one heck of a fertile ground for linkages....the
common office.

I like the shurch idea as well. Other ideas...

Book circles, geocaching groups, heck Rhorho your still young enough to
hit the campus mixers...and I mean the social stuff not the techtech
events.


Above all, ask yourself whats important to you..

Life, you either life it or you waste it.

Perhaps /cannot be heard in any other way (period)/ was incorrect.
What I meant, was a time-specific occurence.  Sure, there are other
means outside of the circumstance of the occurence. BUt until we're
willing to eliminate the ability to speak in public -only- for the
side that doesn't agree with the political force, and make that part
of the 1st amendment, the parties -are- screaming and shouting over
political figures because they cannot be heard (to those figures) in
any other way.

Sure.  And that goes back to my second argument -- Cohen.   THey can
walk away.   NObody compells them to stand there, I'll agree fully.
But we still have a Constitutional right to speak out against
policies, actions and grievances.

Again.  If you want it another way, lets change the Constitution.

  | The background color in this window is the same as the background 
  | color in the ftoc.

That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
than others.

In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
it doesn't need a different background as well.

I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
horizontal, and see what turns up.

  | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
  | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.

OK.

  | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
  | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.

In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
""all unknown"" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)


  | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
  | 
  | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.

Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
(for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
bit too similar.   I ended up using

*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
is probably safer for generic use.
